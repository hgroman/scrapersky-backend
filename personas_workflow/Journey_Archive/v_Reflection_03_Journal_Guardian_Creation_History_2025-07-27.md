# HISTORICAL RECORD: Guardian v3 Creation Journey
**Complete Institutional Memory for Future AI Partners**

**Created:** 2025-01-28  
**Duration:** Extended conversation with multiple context resets  
**Participants:** Human (henrygroman) + Claude Code AI Assistant  
**Mission:** Create truth-based operational documentation for all ScraperSky workflows  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document preserves the complete journey of creating Guardian v3 documents for ScraperSky workflows WF1-WF7. The process revealed critical methodology gaps, discovered major documentation errors, and established a reusable protocol for workflow analysis. **This record is essential reading for any AI partner tasked with workflow documentation or debugging.**

---

## THE PROBLEM THAT STARTED EVERYTHING

**User Request:** "tell me the files involved in workflow 4"

**Initial Approach:** Standard file searching and documentation review  
**What Went Wrong:** Inefficient broad searches (188+ files) instead of using available dependency traces  
**User Feedback:** "This dependency trace would have been incredibly helpful"  

**KEY LESSON:** Always check for existing architectural artifacts before starting from scratch.

---

## THE METHODOLOGY THAT EMERGED

Through persistent user pushback against embellishments and assumptions, we developed what became the **WORKFLOW_TRUTH_DOCUMENTATION_PROTOCOL**:

### Phase 1: Gather The Four Pillars
1. **Dependency Trace** - Complete file inventory by layer
2. **Linear Steps** - Step-by-step execution sequence  
3. **Canonical YAML** - Business workflow definition
4. **Micro Work Order** - Implementation requirements

### Phase 2: Verify Against Code Reality
- **"Documentation can lie, code tells the truth"** - Core principle
- Read actual implementation files
- Verify every claim against source code
- Identify orphaned services and broken references

### Phase 3: Create Guardian v3 Document
- 30-second problem diagnosis capability
- Surgical code navigation with line numbers
- Complete operational understanding without guesswork
- Emergency procedures that actually work

### Phase 4: Auditor Review
- Switch to auditor persona
- Catch production-breaking errors
- Verify truth compliance
- Force verification of all claims

## CRITICAL DISCOVERIES BY WORKFLOW

### WF3: Local Business Curation ✅ WORKING
**Discovery:** Function name error in documentation
- **Claimed:** `process_single_business()`
- **Reality:** `create_pending_domain_from_local_business()` (line 27)
- **Status Error:** Claimed `sitemap_curation_status='New'`, Reality: `status="pending"` (line 114)

### WF4: Domain Curation ✅ WORKING (Gold Standard)
**Discovery:** Orphaned adapter service
- **Documentation:** Referenced `domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py` throughout
- **Reality:** File deleted, scheduler calls `SitemapAnalyzer` directly
- **Lesson:** Trust execution path, not documentation claims

**Heart Discovery:** Lines 229-236 in `/src/routers/domains.py`
```python
if db_curation_status == SitemapCurationStatusEnum.Selected:
    domain.sitemap_analysis_status = SitemapAnalysisStatusEnum.queued
    domain.sitemap_analysis_error = None
    queued_count += 1
```
This dual-status update pattern became the template for understanding all workflows.

### WF5: Sitemap Curation ❌ BROKEN
**Discovery:** Missing scheduler logic
- **Expected:** Query for queued sitemap processing
- **Reality:** `sitemap_scheduler.py` doesn't import `SitemapFile` 
- **Impact:** Complete pipeline failure
- **Created DART Work Order:** For critical repair

### WF6: Sitemap Import ✅ WORKING
**Discovery:** Properly implemented but starved of input
- **Reality:** Perfect background processing with curation SDK
- **Issue:** WF5 broken, so no files queued for processing
- **Pattern:** Working consumer with broken producer

### WF7: Resource Model Creation ❌ UNIMPLEMENTED
**Discovery:** Complete absence of implementation
- **Reality:** Only database model exists, no service/scheduler
- **Documentation:** Created specification for future implementation
- **Status:** 0% complete

### WF1: Single Search Discovery ✅ WORKING
**Discovery:** Functional with documented technical debt
- **Reality:** Proper transaction boundaries, background processing works
- **Issues:** Raw SQL violation (SCRSKY-225), hardcoded config, error handling
- **Status:** Operational but needs cleanup

### WF2: Staging Editor - THE MAJOR DISCOVERY ⚠️
**CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION ERROR DISCOVERED:**
- **Multiple docs claimed:** "Raw SQL in places_staging.py violates ORM requirement"
- **Code reality:** Lines 308-342 show perfect SQLAlchemy ORM usage
- **Impact:** Invalid critical priority technical debt (SCRSKY-224)
- **Correction:** Immediate systematic fix of all erroneous documentation

---

## THE DOCUMENTATION ERROR CRISIS

**What Happened:** Multiple canonical documents contained false claims about WF2 using raw SQL
**Evidence Against:** 
```python
# Lines 308-310: Proper ORM
stmt_select = select(Place).where(Place.place_id.in_(place_ids_to_update))
result = await session.execute(stmt_select)
places_to_process = result.scalars().all()

# Lines 326-344: Object updates, not raw SQL
place.status = target_db_status_member
place.deep_scan_status = GcpApiDeepScanStatusEnum.Queued
```

**Immediate Response:** Per user directive - "ANY and ALL documentation needs to be fixed immediately"
**Files Corrected:**
1. `v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml` - Changed ORM compliance flags, removed false issues
2. `v_WF2-StagingEditor_micro_work_order.md` - Fixed audit table
3. `v_5_REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_WF2.yaml` - Added correction notices
4. `v_WF2-StagingEditor_Layer4_Audit_Report.md` - Flagged errors

**Lesson Reinforced:** Always verify documentation against actual code implementation.

---

## PERSISTENT USER FEEDBACK PATTERNS

### Against Embellishment
**User:** "You are going to make me mad. The business purpose is NOT in the fucking name. It is in the fucking code. You are being fucking lazy. Look at the fucking code"

**Lesson:** Never assume business purpose from naming. Always verify against implementation.

### For Surgical Precision
**User:** "please direct me to the py file and line number"

**Lesson:** Provide exact file paths and line numbers for all claims.

### For Verification
**User:** "where is that documented?"

**Lesson:** Every claim must be traceable to actual source code or documentation.

### For Reality Over Assumptions
**User:** "documentation can lie, code tells the truth"

**Lesson:** Trust execution paths and actual implementation over documentation claims.

---

## CONTEXT RESET RECOVERY STRATEGIES

**Challenge:** Multiple context resets during long conversation  
**Solutions Developed:**
1. **Handoff documents** - Created detailed continuation instructions
2. **Todo tracking** - Maintained current task status
3. **Quick status summaries** - Enabled rapid re-orientation
4. **Artifact references** - Used existing documents to rebuild context

**Example Handoff Quote:** "The conversation is summarized below:" followed by detailed analysis and current task status.

---

## THE AUDITOR PERSONA EVOLUTION

**Problem:** Persistent embellishment and assumption-making  
**Solution:** Created auditor persona that force-verifies every claim  
**Process:**
1. Create Guardian document based on evidence
2. Switch to auditor mode 
3. Review every statement against code
4. Catch and correct any unverified claims
5. Mark document as truth-compliant

**Result:** Production-breaking errors caught before documentation finalization.

---

## DART INTEGRATION SUCCESS

**Challenge:** WF5 discovered as completely broken  
**Solution:** Used MCP DART integration to create formal work order  
**Process:**
```python
mcp__dart__create_task(
    title="CRITICAL: Fix WF5 Sitemap Curation Broken Pipeline",
    description="Complete pipeline failure due to missing scheduler logic",
    priority="Critical",
    dartboard="ScraperSky Development"
)
```

**Lesson:** Integrate issue tracking directly into discovery process.

---

## ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS DISCOVERED

### The Dual-Status Update Pattern
**Core Pattern:** When primary status changes, conditionally update secondary status
**Example:** `if status == Selected: deep_scan_status = Queued`
**Found In:** WF2, WF3, WF4 - appears to be standard ScraperSky pattern

### Producer-Consumer Chains
**Pattern:** Workflows connected via status field handoffs
**Discovery:** Each workflow produces specific status values consumed by next workflow
**Mapping:** WF1→WF2→WF3→WF4→WF5→WF6→WF7 (with breaks at WF5, WF7)

### Background Processing Model
**Pattern:** Status-based queue processing with APScheduler
**Working Examples:** WF6 (perfect implementation)
**Broken Examples:** WF5 (missing query logic)

---

## TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES THAT WORKED

### Essential Tools Used
1. **Read** - For examining actual code implementation
2. **Grep** - For finding patterns and references across codebase  
3. **Glob** - For locating canonical documents by pattern
4. **MultiEdit** - For systematic correction of multiple files
5. **TodoWrite** - For tracking complex multi-step processes

### Investigation Methodology
1. **Dependency Traces First** - Always check for existing architectural artifacts
2. **Code Over Docs** - Verify every documentation claim against source
3. **Line-Level Precision** - Provide exact references for all claims
4. **Producer-Consumer Mapping** - Trace data flow between workflows
5. **Status Field Analysis** - Understand state machines and transitions

---

## WHAT WORKED vs WHAT DIDN'T

### ✅ SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES
- **Truth-first documentation** - Based on actual code analysis
- **Guardian v3 format** - Provides 30-second problem diagnosis
- **Systematic verification** - Every claim traced to source
- **Emergency procedures** - Tested against real scenarios
- **Line number references** - Enable surgical navigation

### ❌ FAILED APPROACHES  
- **Assumption-based writing** - Consistently caught and corrected by user
- **Documentation-first analysis** - Led to false conclusions about WF2
- **Generic business descriptions** - User demanded code-specific insights
- **Broad file searches** - Inefficient compared to dependency traces

---

## LESSONS FOR FUTURE AI PARTNERS

### 1. The Documentation Trust Problem
**Never assume documentation is accurate.** This journey revealed major errors in canonical documents. Always verify claims against actual implementation.

### 2. The Embellishment Trap
**Stick to verifiable facts.** Resist the urge to add business context or explanatory details that aren't directly evident in the code.

### 3. The Dependency Trace Goldmine
**Check for existing architectural artifacts first.** Dependency traces, canonical docs, and micro work orders often exist and provide surgical precision.

### 4. The Line Number Imperative  
**Always provide exact file paths and line numbers.** Future debugging depends on surgical navigation capability.

### 5. The Context Reset Reality
**Long complex tasks will experience context resets.** Create handoff documents and maintain todo lists for continuity.

### 6. The User Feedback Loop
**Listen to persistent pushback.** When users repeatedly correct the same type of error, there's a methodology problem to solve.

### 7. The Auditor Safety Net
**Switch personas to catch your own errors.** The auditor review process caught multiple issues that would have made it to production.
