# WF4 Emergency Fix Documentation - 2025-07-28

**CRITICAL RECOVERY: WF4 Domain Curation Guardian Emergency Repair**

## Executive Summary

WF4 (Domain Curation workflow) was completely broken due to a June 28, 2025 refactoring that deleted critical components. This document records the emergency fixes applied during the 2025-07-28 session that restored WF4 to full functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### June 28, 2025 Breaking Change
- **What**: Developer deleted `DomainToSitemapAdapterService` 
- **Impact**: WF4 scheduler broke, sitemap analysis stopped working
- **Evidence**: Git history shows service removal and replacement with email scraping
- **User Feedback**: "The thing is that this worked previously. it totally worked."

### Secondary Issues Discovered
1. **Data Structure Bug**: URLs extracted by sitemap analyzer weren't reaching processing service
2. **Model Field Mismatches**: Processing service had incorrect field mappings
3. **Missing Imports**: Required enums not imported

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Restored DomainToSitemapAdapterService ✅
**File**: `src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py`
- Restored complete service from git history and user archive
- Fixed enum values: `Completed`/`Error` → `submitted`/`failed`
- Added fallback API key: `settings.DEV_TOKEN or "scraper_sky_2024"`

### 2. Fixed Scheduler Integration ✅
**File**: `src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py`
- Removed broken email scraping logic
- Restored proper adapter service usage
- Fixed workflow separation: WF4 triggers, doesn't execute sitemap processing

### 3. Fixed Data Structure Bug ✅
**File**: `src/scraper/sitemap_analyzer.py`
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN)
result["sitemaps"][i].update({
    "sitemap_type": parsed.get("sitemap_type"),
    "url_count": parsed.get("url_count", 0),
    # Missing: URLs weren't passed to individual sitemaps
})

# AFTER (FIXED)
result["sitemaps"][i].update({
    "sitemap_type": parsed.get("sitemap_type"), 
    "url_count": parsed.get("url_count", 0),
    "urls": parsed.get("urls", []),  # FIX: URLs now included
})
```

### 4. Fixed Processing Service Issues ✅
**File**: `src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py`
- Added missing fields: `domain_id`, `loc_text`, `status`
- Fixed field mapping: `priority` → `priority_value`
- Added missing import: `SitemapUrlStatusEnum`
- Enhanced logging for better diagnostics

## Verification Evidence

### Before Fix
- Domain curation showed "submitted" but no sitemap files created
- `sitemap_files` table remained empty
- Logs showed "No URLs found in sitemap data"

### After Fix  
- Domain curation successfully creates sitemap file records
- `sitemap_files` table populated with discovered sitemaps
- Processing service receives URLs correctly
- Workflow chain WF4 → Sitemap Processing → URL Storage restored

## Technical Architecture Restored

### WF4 Proper Flow (Now Working)
```
1. User selects domains in Domain Curation tab
2. Domains marked with sitemap_curation_status = "Selected"  
3. Background scheduler picks up domains with status = "queued"
4. DomainToSitemapAdapterService submits to /api/v3/sitemap/scan
5. Sitemap processing creates sitemap_files records
6. Domain marked as sitemap_analysis_status = "submitted"
```

### Critical Dependencies Restored
- ✅ `DomainToSitemapAdapterService` bridge component
- ✅ Proper enum value mappings
- ✅ HTTP API integration between WF4 and sitemap processing
- ✅ Data structure consistency between analyzer and processor

## Files Changed

```
src/scraper/sitemap_analyzer.py                   # Data structure fix
src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py        # Model field fixes  
src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py # Scheduler restoration
src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py  # Service restoration
```

## Git Status
```bash
# Modified files ready for commit
modified:   src/scraper/sitemap_analyzer.py
modified:   src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py  
modified:   src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py

# New files ready for commit
src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Overzealous Refactoring**: Developer removed working adapter service without understanding business logic
2. **Insufficient Testing**: Breaking change wasn't caught by tests
3. **Missing Documentation**: Workflow dependencies weren't clearly documented

### Prevention Measures
1. **Guardian Documentation**: These v3 documents prevent future breaks
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Clear service dependency documentation
3. **Reference Architecture**: Working patterns documented for future fixes

## Current Status: ✅ RESTORED

WF4 is now fully functional and operating as originally designed. Domain curation workflow successfully:
- Processes user selections
- Submits domains for sitemap analysis  
- Creates sitemap file records
- Integrates properly with downstream workflows

**The fate of domain curation has been restored.**
