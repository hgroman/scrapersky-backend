### **verify_contact.py**
**Purpose:** Contact data validation and verification  
**Function:**
- Validates contact data integrity
- Checks for duplicate contacts
- Verifies contact-to-page relationships
- Data quality assurance

**Usage:** `python verify_contact.py`

## 🚨 **CRITICAL OPERATIONAL TRUTHS**

### **Dual Service Endpoint Pattern**
**Files:** `src/routers/v3/WF7_V3_L3_1of1_PagesRouter.py` (Lines 140-143)  
**Truth:** When `page_curation_status = 'Selected'` → router automatically sets `page_processing_status = 'Queued'`  
**Failure:** Direct database changes bypass this critical logic, creating orphaned pages

### **Scheduler Pattern**  
**Truth:** Scheduler looks for `page_processing_status = 'Queued'` (NOT page_curation_status)  
**Runs:** Every minute via APScheduler  
**Processes:** Pages through complete pipeline (Queued → Processing → Complete)

### **Contact Creation Reality**
**Truth:** System creates contacts when it works (proven with 62 → 91 contact growth)  
**Placeholders:** Uses unique `notfound_{page_id}@domain` when no real contacts found  
**Real Extraction:** Successfully extracts emails/phones from pages with real contact info

## 📊 **QUICK DIAGNOSTIC QUERIES**

### Health Check
```sql
SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pages WHERE page_curation_status = 'Selected' AND page_processing_status = 'Complete') as pages_complete,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts) as total_contacts;
```

### Find Orphaned Pages
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pages 
WHERE page_curation_status = 'Selected' 
AND page_processing_status IS NULL;
```

### Processing Pipeline Status
```sql
SELECT page_processing_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM pages WHERE page_curation_status = 'Selected' 
GROUP BY page_processing_status;
```

## 🎯 **WHEN TO USE THIS TOOLBOX**

**For System Health:** Use `check_new_contacts.py` and `check_page_status.py`  
**For Troubleshooting:** Reference the Journal and Evidence documents for root cause patterns  
**For Recovery:** Use `reset_selected_pages.py` for orphaned page fixes  
**For Validation:** Use `test_wf7_end_to_end.py` after any system changes  
**For Monitoring:** Use `monitor_production.py` for ongoing system surveillance
