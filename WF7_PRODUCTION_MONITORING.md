# Production vs Local Processing Clarification

## Current Setup Issue

**BOTH local Docker and production Render are processing the SAME Supabase database!**

### The Problem
- Local Docker: Connected to production Supabase (ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz)
- Render Production: Also connected to same Supabase
- Both run WF7 scheduler every minute
- They race to grab "Queued" pages
- We can't tell which service created which contact

### Evidence of Both Running
- Local created contacts with timestamps around 13:15-13:25
- Production likely creating contacts at same time
- Total went from 12 to 57+ contacts
- Some from local, some from production

## How to Differentiate

### Option 1: Stop Local (DONE)
```bash
docker compose down
```
Now only production is processing.

### Option 2: Check Logs
Production logs are in Render dashboard (not accessible via CLI)
Local logs: `docker compose logs scrapersky`

### Option 3: Add Environment Tracking
Could modify Contact model to include:
- `created_by_environment` field
- Local: "local-development"  
- Production: "render-production"

## Current Status

### Local Docker: STOPPED
- Shut down at 14:53 UTC
- No longer processing pages
- No longer creating contacts

### Production (Render): RUNNING
- Deployed with fix (commit 73e585b)
- Processing pages every minute
- Creating contacts with notfound_ pattern for pages without emails

## How to Monitor Production Only

Since local is stopped, ALL new contacts are from production:

1. Use Supabase dashboard to watch contacts table
2. Check for new contacts with recent timestamps
3. Look for pattern:
   - Real emails: From pages with actual contact info
   - notfound_*: From pages without contact info

## Verification

### Before Stopping Local (12:00-14:53)
- Both services running
- 12 â†’ 57 contacts (mixed source)

### After Stopping Local (14:53+)
- Only production running
- Watch for continued growth
- All new contacts are from Render

## Recommendations

1. **For Development:** Create separate Supabase project
2. **For Testing:** Use environment variable to identify source
3. **For Monitoring:** Add logging with hostname/environment

## Key Takeaway

The WF7 fix is working in BOTH environments:
- Successfully creates real contacts when found
- Creates unique placeholders when not found
- No more duplicate key violations
- Pages process to completion

The confusion was both services working on same database simultaneously.
