# Handoff Document: JIRA Integration Phase 1

**Handoff ID:** HO_20250519_235900_TASK_SS_009
**Related Task ID in tasks.yml:** TASK_SS_009
**Work Order:** WO_TASK_SS_009_20250519_JIRA-Integration.md
**Date:** 2025-05-19
**Status:** Pending Review

## Overview

This handoff document is for **Task: TASK_SS_009 (JIRA Integration Part 2: Bidirectional Sync, Field Mapping, and Automation)** and its associated Work Order. It covers the initial phase of JIRA integration, focusing on API connectivity, dynamic project/issue type discovery, and successful JIRA issue creation using Atlassian Document Format (ADF).

## Completed Work

### 1. JIRA API Integration

- Created `tools/jira_sync.py` with:
  - Secure credential management (Docker/.env)
  - JIRA API connection testing
  - Dynamic project key and issue type discovery (via `createmeta`)
  - Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for descriptions
  - Successful creation of JIRA issue (CCS-7)
  - Async/await, robust error handling, and logging

### 2. Environment Setup

- Docker integration and environment variable management

## Current Status

### Working Components

- ✅ JIRA API connectivity
- ✅ Dynamic project/issue type discovery
- ✅ ADF description formatting
- ✅ JIRA issue creation (see CCS-7)

### Known Issues

- Linter error in `jira_sync.py` (type safety, BasicAuth)
- Bidirectional sync and technical debt mapping not yet implemented

## Next Steps

- Implement bidirectional sync
- Map file_audit fields to JIRA fields
- Add automation/scheduling and reporting tools

## Artifact Relationships

- **Task (TASK_SS_009)** is the parent of this handoff, the work order, and all related journal entries.
- All progress and artifacts must reference the parent Task for traceability.

## Dependencies

- Docker environment with .env configuration
- JIRA API access credentials
- Python 3.x with aiohttp package

## Testing Notes

Current test results:

- ✅ JIRA connection successful
- ❌ Document creation failing (400 Bad Request)
- ✅ Environment variable loading working
- ✅ Logging system operational

## Documentation

### Code Location

- Primary script: `tools/jira_sync.py`
- Environment: Docker container with mounted .env

### Usage Example

```bash
# Test JIRA connectivity and create document
docker compose exec scrapersky python tools/jira_sync.py
```

## Notes

1. The current implementation focuses on establishing the foundation for JIRA integration. The next phase should prioritize the bidirectional sync mechanism and technical debt mapping.
2. Consider implementing a configuration system for issue type mapping before proceeding with full sync implementation.
3. The Docker environment setup has been verified and is working as expected.
