# Dependency Resolution Incident: June 27, 2025

**DART Task ID:** [Insert DART Task ID]  
**Date:** 2025-06-27  
**Participants:** Henry Groman, Registry Librarian (AI)

## Executive Summary

This document details the systematic resolution of critical dependency conflicts in the ScraperSky backend that were causing build failures in the Render deployment environment. The issue stemmed from incompatible version requirements between `supabase` and other packages in the dependency chain. Through methodical investigation and testing, we identified and resolved multiple layers of conflicts by removing specific version constraints, allowing pip's dependency resolver to find a compatible configuration.

## Incident Timeline

| Time (PDT) | Event | Details |
|------------|-------|---------|
| ~20:30 | Initial build failure | Render build failing due to dependency conflicts between `httpx` and `supabase-py` |
| 20:50 | First fix attempt | Modified `httpx` version from `0.28.1` to `>=0.21.3,<0.22.0` |
| 20:54 | Second conflict | New error with `httpcore` version requirements |
| 20:57 | Second fix attempt | Modified `httpcore` version to `>=0.14.0,<0.15.0` |
| 21:00 | Third conflict | New error with `h11` dependency requirements |
| 21:02 | Third fix attempt | Modified `h11` version to `>=0.11.0,<0.13.0` |
| 21:04 | Fourth conflict | Discovered fundamental conflict between `supabase` and `httpx` versions |
| 21:05 | Final solution | Removed version constraints for `httpx`, `httpcore`, `h11`, and `supabase` |
| 21:06 | Verification | Successfully built Docker image locally |
| 21:07 | Deployment | Pushed changes to GitHub for Render deployment |

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Dependency Chain Conflict

We identified a complex dependency chain conflict:

1. **Primary Conflict:**
   - `supabase` package requires `httpx >=0.24.0`
   - `supabase-py` (or another dependency) requires `httpx <0.22.0`
   - These requirements are fundamentally incompatible

2. **Secondary Conflicts:**
   - `httpx 0.21.3` requires `httpcore >=0.14.0, <0.15.0`
   - `httpcore 0.14.0` requires `h11 >=0.11.0, <0.13.0`
   - Our requirements had incompatible versions for these packages

3. **Structural Issue:**
   - The requirements.txt file mixed direct and transitive dependencies
   - Many dependencies were pinned to exact versions, limiting flexibility

## Resolution Process

### Methodical Approach

1. **Incremental Fixes:**
   - Initially attempted to resolve conflicts by adjusting specific package versions
   - Each fix revealed another layer in the dependency chain conflict

2. **Local Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Created `test_docker_build.sh` script to test builds locally
   - Enabled rapid iteration without waiting for cloud deployment

3. **Final Solution:**
   - Removed version constraints for the conflicting packages
   - Allowed pip's dependency resolver to find a compatible configuration
   - Verified solution with local Docker build before deployment

## Key Learnings

1. **Dependency Management Best Practices:**
   - Separate direct dependencies from transitive dependencies
   - Use flexible version constraints where possible
   - Pin versions only when necessary for stability
   - Document known conflicts and constraints

2. **Testing Infrastructure:**
   - Always test dependency changes locally before cloud deployment
   - Docker-based testing provides environment parity with production

3. **Dependency Chain Awareness:**
   - Modern Python applications often have deep dependency chains
   - Conflicts can occur several layers deep in the dependency tree
   - Understanding the full dependency graph is essential for resolution

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Monitor Render builds to confirm resolution
   - Document the known conflict between `supabase` and `httpx` in requirements.txt

2. **Short-term Improvements:**
   - Implement separated requirements structure:
     - `requirements/base.txt`: Direct dependencies with flexible constraints
     - `requirements/dev.txt`: Development-only tools
     - `requirements/prod.txt`: Production deployment with locked versions

3. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Migrate to a more robust dependency management tool:
     - `pip-tools` for simpler projects
     - `poetry` for more complex dependency management
   - Implement automated dependency scanning in CI pipeline
   - Regular dependency audits to identify and resolve potential conflicts

## Artifacts

1. **Code Changes:**
   - [GitHub Commit](https://github.com/hgroman/scrapersky-backend/commit/8a11e84): "Fix dependency conflicts by removing version constraints for httpx, httpcore, h11, and supabase"

2. **Testing Tools:**
   - `test_docker_build.sh`: Local Docker build testing script

3. **Documentation:**
   - This handoff document
   - Updated requirements structure (proposed)

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the importance of robust dependency management practices in modern Python applications. By implementing the recommendations outlined in this document, the ScraperSky backend will be better positioned to avoid similar issues in the future and maintain a stable, reliable build process.
