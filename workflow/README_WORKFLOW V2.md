‚úàÔ∏è Flight Manual: DART Control Tower Workflow Protocol
üõ©Ô∏è CONTROL TOWER FLIGHT CLEARANCE RULE üõ©Ô∏è
NO AIRCRAFT MAY DEPART WITHOUT FILED FLIGHT PLAN
ALL work MUST begin by creating a DART Flight Plan (Task) using MCP in the primary dartboard, e.g., 'n8n/Tasks'. When continuing existing work, ensure the Flight Plan in DART remains the authoritative source for all related flight operations.
NO flight activity (journal entry, work order, handoff document) may reference a Flight Plan that does not exist in DART Control Tower.
Flight activities referencing non-existent Flight Plans are GROUNDED and must be corrected immediately.
NO EXCEPTIONS. This is air traffic control law.
Flight Manual Version: 1.1

Control Tower: DART MCP Integration

Effective Date: 2025-07-24

Authority: The Fifth Beatle - Air Traffic Controller

Location Recommendation: Move to dedicated 'n8n/SOPs' folder for core standards; currently in 'n8n/Handoff-Docs' as transitional.
üéØ MISSION STATEMENT
This Flight Manual establishes the DART Control Tower as the authoritative air traffic control system for all project operations. Every work session is a flight operation requiring proper clearance, navigation, and landing procedures. The system ensures safe, efficient, and traceable project execution across multiple AI pilots and human air traffic controllers.
