## 1. Summary of Work Completed

Successfully resolved the `DatatypeMismatchError` by ensuring the `batch_id` in `Job` creation is correctly handled as a `UUID`, even when `None`. The fix involved modifying `website_scan_service.py` to accept a typed `batch_id` and updating `domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py` to provide it.

## 2. Confirmation of Completion

- [x] All code changes have been committed and pushed to `origin/main`.
- [x] All required documentation artifacts (Work Order, Journal Entry, Handoff Document) have been created as per the workflow.
- [x] The associated DART task `pKVW7vflIRWA` is marked as 'Done'.

## 3. Handoff Status

This task is now complete. The fix is live in the `main` branch and will be deployed by Render. No further action is required for this issue.
