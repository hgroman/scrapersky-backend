**Participants:** Henry Groman, AI Assistant (Workflow Specialist)
**Related Task:** TASK_SS_005

## Summary
Consolidated and standardized the workflow directory structure by moving all related files into a single `workflow` directory and ensuring consistent naming conventions. Updated all references to reflect the new structure.

## Detailed Description

### Changes Made
1. **Directory Restructuring**
   - Moved the following directories into the `workflow` folder:
     - `Handoff`
     - `Journal`
     - `work_orders` â†’ `Work_Orders`
     - `Personas`
     - `Guides`
   - Moved key workflow files into the `workflow` directory:
     - `README_WORKFLOW.md`
     - `journal_index.yml`
     - `tasks.yml`

2. **File Reference Updates**
   - Updated all references to `docs/guides/` to point to the new `Guides/` directory
   - Verified and corrected paths in all workflow-related documents
   - Ensured consistent naming conventions across all files

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `README_WORKFLOW.md` to reflect the new directory structure
   - Verified all internal links and references in workflow documents

### Technical Details
- Standardized on Title Case for all directory names
- Maintained backward compatibility by updating all references
- Ensured all documentation accurately reflects the current project structure

### Next Steps
- [ ] Verify all automated processes that might depend on these paths
- [ ] Update any CI/CD pipelines that reference the old paths
- [ ] Document the new structure in the main project README

## Decisions Made
- Chose to move all workflow-related files under a single `workflow` directory for better organization
- Decided to use Title Case for all directory names to maintain consistency
- Opted to keep all workflow documentation within the workflow directory for better portability
