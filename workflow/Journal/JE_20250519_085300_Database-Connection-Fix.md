**Participants:** Henry Groman, AI Assistant (Cascade)

## Summary

Successfully diagnosed and fixed database connection issues in the ScraperSky backend that were preventing the application from accessing data from Supabase. The fix enables proper functioning of the web interface tabs that display information from the database.

## Problem Description

The ScraperSky backend was experiencing issues with database connections to Supabase. The main symptoms were:

1. Most API endpoints were returning 500 Internal Server Error responses
2. Docker logs showed errors: `TypeError: connect() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sslmode'`
3. The web interface tabs that display information from the database were not showing any data

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the codebase and logs, we identified that the issue was related to incompatible connection parameters in the DATABASE_URL environment variable:

1. The application uses asyncpg 0.30.0 for database connectivity
2. The connection string included parameters (`sslmode=require`, `raw_sql=true`, `no_prepare=true`, `statement_cache_size=0`) that are not directly supported by asyncpg 0.30.0
3. The username format in the connection string needed to include the Supabase project reference (`postgres.[project-ref]`)

## Solution Implemented

1. Created a debug script (`debug_api.py`) to test API endpoints and diagnose issues
2. Updated the DATABASE_URL in the .env file to use only compatible parameters:
   ```
   # Before
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:8UEz4hZ9ohtGi81F@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

   # After
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz:8UEz4hZ9ohtGi81F@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?ssl=true
   ```
3. Restarted the Docker container to apply the changes
4. Verified that key API endpoints (`/api/v3/domains` and `/api/v3/local-businesses`) now return 200 OK responses with data

## Results

After implementing the fix:

1. The `/api/v3/domains` endpoint now returns a 200 OK with domain data
2. The `/api/v3/local-businesses` endpoint now returns a 200 OK with business data
3. The web interface tabs that depend on these endpoints now display data correctly

Some endpoints still need further investigation:
- `/health/db` - Returns 404, suggesting this endpoint might not be implemented
- `/api/v3/sitemap` - Returns 404, which could be due to different path naming
- `/api/v3/sitemap-files` - Returns a 307 redirect, suggesting it might be redirecting to a different path

## Lessons Learned

1. Database connection parameters need to be carefully matched to the specific version of the database driver being used
2. When using Supabase with connection pooling, the correct username format is critical (`postgres.[project-ref]`)
3. Simplifying connection parameters can help isolate and resolve issues more effectively
4. Creating diagnostic tools (like debug_api.py) is valuable for systematically testing API endpoints

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring the application for any new database connection issues
2. Investigate the remaining endpoints that are still returning non-200 responses
3. Document the correct connection string format in the project documentation for future reference
4. Consider adding a database health check endpoint to simplify diagnostics in the future
