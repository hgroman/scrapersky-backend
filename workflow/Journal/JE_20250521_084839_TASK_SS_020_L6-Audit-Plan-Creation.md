summary: |
  Created and subsequently enhanced the Layer 6 UI Components Audit Plan (Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-6.2-UI_Components_Audit-Plan.md).
  The initial plan was developed by synthesizing information from the Layer 6 Blueprint, SOP, and the comprehensive file matrix.
  Enhancements were made based on user feedback and lessons learned from previous audit plan creation and execution cycles.
  A new section 'Critical Reminders for the Auditor AI (Meta-Guidance)' was added to provide explicit instructions to the AI persona that will execute the audit. This section covers:
  1.  Immutable Audit Scope (No Refactoring): Emphasizing that the audit is for documentation only.
  2.  Authoritative Document Adherence: Stressing reliance on Blueprint and SOP.
  3.  Precise Reporting & Output: Detailing report location and the need for a comprehensive summary.
  4.  Workflow Process Awareness: Providing context on overall project tracking.
  5.  Proactive Clarification: Encouraging the auditor to ask questions rather than make assumptions.
  The conclusion was also augmented to reinforce the expectation of a comprehensive summary in the audit report and to reiterate that the audit is an information-gathering phase.
  These changes aim to improve the quality and efficiency of the upcoming Layer 6 audit.
