# Completion Report: Workflow Artifact Audit and Correction (TASK_SS_010)

**Date Completed:** 2025-05-20
**Executed By:** David (Shepherd), AI Director
**Work Order Reference:** workflow/Work_Orders/active/WO_TASK_SS_010_20250519_WorkflowArtifactAudit.md

## Summary of Audit Activities

A systematic audit of workflow artifacts (tasks.yml, Journal Entries, Work Orders, and Handoff Documents) was conducted to ensure consistency in naming conventions, task linking, and adherence to the "Task is god" principle, as defined in workflow/README_WORKFLOW.md.

## Files Scanned and Corrected

- **Journal Entries (`workflow/Journal/`):**
    - Scanned: 9 files (excluding .DS_Store, .gitkeep)
    - Corrected Filenames: 4 files (JE_..._TASK042, JE_..., JE_..., JE_...)
    - Updated `journal_index.yml` to reflect corrected filenames and added missing `related_task_id` for 7 entries based on filename.

- **Work Orders (`workflow/Work_Orders/`):
    - Scanned `active/`: 7 files
    - Corrected Filenames/Internal Task IDs: 4 files (WO_TASK042, WO_TASK043, WO_TASK044, WO_TASK046) - renamed/updated to reference TASK_SS_008, TASK_SS_009, TASK_SS_011, TASK_SS_012. Added 2 new tasks (TASK_SS_011, TASK_SS_012) to `tasks.yml`.
    - Scanned `completed/`: 1 file (WO_TASK_META...) - noted for review.
    - Scanned `Archive/`: 0 files.

- **Handoff Documents (`workflow/Handoff/`):**
    - Scanned top-level: 1 file (empty, improperly named) - noted for review.
    - Scanned `pending_review/`: 1 file (HO_..._TASK044...) - renamed/updated to reference TASK_SS_009.

- **`tasks.yml`:**
    - Reviewed existing tasks.
    - Added 2 new tasks (TASK_SS_011, TASK_SS_012).

## Unresolvable Inconsistencies Requiring Review (`NEEDS_REVIEW_`)

The following artifacts could not be fully corrected due to missing information or ambiguities and require user clarification:

-   **workflow/Work_Orders/completed/WO_TASK_META_20250517_Meta-Rules-Consolidation.md:** References `TASK_META` in its filename and related journal entry (workflow/Journal/JE_20250516_230523_TASK_META_Meta-Rules-Applied.md), but `TASK_META` is not defined in the provided `tasks.yml`. Clarification is needed on the status and details of TASK_META.
-   **workflow/Handoff/2025-05-15_204320_WO-COMP-CREATE-001_InProgress.md:** This file in the `workflow/Handoff/` directory is empty and has a filename format (`WO-COMP-CREATE-001...`) that does not match the Handoff convention (`HO_...md`) and does not reference a Task ID. It appears to be a broken or misplaced artifact. Clarification is needed on its intended purpose or if it should be removed.

## Success Criteria Met

-   All files in `workflow/Journal/`, `workflow/Work_Orders/active/`, and `workflow/Handoff/pending_review/` (excluding those noted above) now conform to the documented naming conventions and reference valid Task IDs in their filenames and content.
-   workflow/journal_index.yml is updated to accurately reflect the corrected journal entries.
-   `tasks.yml` has been reviewed and updated with new tasks identified from Work Orders.

## Recommendation

It is recommended that `TASK_SS_010` in `tasks.yml` be updated from `status: todo` to `status: done` to reflect the completion of this audit and correction Work Order.
