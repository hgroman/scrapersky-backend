# Journal Entry: Temporarily Disabling Pre-commit Hooks

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Time:** 14:52:33 PT
**Task ID:** TASK_SS_017
**Participants:** User (Henry Groman), AI Assistant (Cascade)

## 1. Objective

To temporarily disable all pre-commit hooks as per explicit user directive. The user indicated that the pre-commit hooks were consistently causing workflow friction and interfering with the commit process, leading to frustration and repeated corrective actions.

## 2. Action Taken

The `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file was modified. The following hooks were commented out to disable them:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      # - id: end-of-file-fixer
      # - id: trailing-whitespace
```

This change effectively bypasses the pre-commit checks during `git commit` operations.

## 3. Rationale

The primary reason for this action is to remove a persistent source of frustration and inefficiency in the development workflow. While pre-commit hooks serve a valuable purpose in maintaining code quality and consistency, their current behavior in this environment was deemed overly disruptive by the user. The user has indicated they will re-enable them at a later time.

## 4. Next Steps

*   The modified `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will be committed to the repository along with all other pending changes.
*   This journal entry and `TASK_SS_017` document this action.

---
*This entry records the temporary disabling of pre-commit hooks to improve workflow efficiency based on user feedback.*
