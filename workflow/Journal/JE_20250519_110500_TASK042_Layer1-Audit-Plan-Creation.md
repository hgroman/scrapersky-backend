# Journal Entry: Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs) Audit Plan Creation

**Date:** 2025-05-19
**Time:** 11:05:00
**Task ID:** TASK042
**Author:** Cascade AI
**Status:** Completed

## Summary

Created a comprehensive, actionable audit plan for Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs) of the ScraperSky backend. This plan is designed to systematically identify and address technical debt while ensuring compliance with architectural standards.

## Actions Performed

1. Analyzed existing documentation:
   - Layer-1-Models_Enums_Blueprint.md
   - Layer-1-Models_Enums_AI_Audit_SOP.md
   - CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md

2. Created a structured audit plan with:
   - Specific files to audit for each workflow
   - Detailed checklist of principles to verify for each file
   - Current vs. standard implementation notes for status fields
   - Process for handling the 200-line limitation when using AI

3. Cleaned up previous documentation:
   - Removed Layer-1-Models-Detailed-Plan.md
   - Removed Layer-3-Routers-Detailed-Plan.md
   - Removed Layer-4-Services-Detailed-Plan.md
   - Removed Layer-by-Layer-Audit-Plan.md

4. Added explicit guidance for handling the 200-line limitation when viewing files with AI

## Outputs

- Created `/workflow/Plans/Layer-1-Models-Actionable-Audit-Plan.md`
- This plan provides a practical, file-by-file approach to auditing Layer 1 components

## Observations

1. The Layer 1 audit is a logical starting point as it forms the foundation of the application architecture
2. Most status fields do not follow the current naming convention (`{workflow_name}_{type}_status`)
3. Only WF7-PageCuration appears to be fully compliant with current naming standards
4. The 200-line limitation when viewing files with AI requires a systematic approach to ensure complete coverage

## Next Steps

1. Begin the Layer 1 audit with the first file (`src/models/place_search.py`)
2. Create similar actionable audit plans for Layer 3 (Routers) and Layer 4 (Services)
3. Update the tasks.yml to reflect the completion of this task and the creation of new audit tasks
