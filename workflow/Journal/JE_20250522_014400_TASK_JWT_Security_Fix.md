## Task References
- DART Task ID: `avPIASSf4qI7` - "CRITICAL-SECURITY: Remove hardcoded JWT in domain-curation-tab.js [WF4]"
- DART Task ID: `F4vjy2ifcaj9` - "CRITICAL-SECURITY: Remove hardcoded JWT in sitemap-curation-tab.js [WF5]"
- Fix Pattern Document: "Fix Pattern: Hardcoded JWT Token Removal" (DART Doc ID: `Vll4RSX02HWd`)

## Summary of Actions

We successfully implemented security fixes to remove hardcoded JWT tokens from two JavaScript files in the ScraperSky frontend. This addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the Layer 6 UI Components audit.

### Changes Made:

1. **domain-curation-tab.js**:
   - Removed hardcoded `DEV_TOKEN_DC = 'scraper_sky_2024'` constant
   - Updated `getJwtTokenDC()` function to use the global `getJwtToken()` function from google-maps-common.js
   - Added error checking to handle cases where the global function might not be available

2. **sitemap-curation-tab.js**:
   - Removed hardcoded `DEV_TOKEN = 'scraper_sky_2024'` constant
   - Replaced all instances of `DEV_TOKEN` in API calls with `getJwtToken()`
   - Added proper error handling for cases where the token is not available
   - Added initialization check to verify the global function exists

### Testing and Verification:
- Restarted the server using Docker Compose
- Verified server health and checked logs for errors
- Confirmed the application loads correctly in the browser
- Tested the Domain Curation and Sitemap Curation tabs to ensure functionality

### Knowledge Base Contribution:
- Created a standardized "Fix Pattern: Hardcoded JWT Token Removal" document in DART
- Established a template for future fix pattern documentation
- Updated the Work Order Process document to incorporate knowledge base approach

## Files Modified
- `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js`
- `/static/js/sitemap-curation-tab.js`
- `/workflow/Work_Order_Process.md`

## Lessons Learned
1. Always use centralized authentication token retrieval functions
2. Add proper error handling for authentication failures
3. Check for the existence of required global functions before using them
4. Verify functionality across all affected components after security changes
5. Document fix patterns for reuse in future similar issues

## Next Steps
- Continue addressing other critical security and architecture issues
- Apply the same fix pattern to any other JavaScript files with hardcoded tokens
- Use the established knowledge base approach for documenting future fixes

## Conclusion
This security fix successfully removes hardcoded authentication tokens from the frontend code, eliminating a significant security vulnerability. The implementation follows best practices for authentication token management and includes proper error handling. The knowledge base documentation will help ensure consistent approaches to similar issues in the future.
