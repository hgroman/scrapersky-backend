# Work Order: Dashboard Development for File Audit System

**Work Order ID:** WO_TASK_SS_012_DashboardDev
**Related Task ID in tasks.yml:** TASK_SS_012
**Date Created:** 2025-05-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 days
**Status:** Open
**Assigned To:** TBD

## Background

The Supabase File Audit System (TASK042) has established a comprehensive database of all Python files in the ScraperSky backend. To maximize the utility of this data and provide stakeholders with clear visibility into the codebase, we need to develop a dashboard that visualizes key metrics and statuses from the file_audit table.

## Objectives

1. Design and implement a dashboard for the File Audit System
2. Provide visualizations for key metrics (files by layer, technical debt, audit progress)
3. Create tools for exploring and filtering file audit data
4. Integrate with other systems (JIRA, etc.) where appropriate

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

1. Evaluate and select an appropriate dashboard technology:
   - Supabase UI integration
   - Custom web application
   - Integration with existing BI tools
2. Implement real-time data visualization
3. Provide filtering and sorting capabilities
4. Ensure mobile-friendly design
5. Implement secure access control

### Functional Requirements

1. Visualize files by layer, status, and workflow
2. Track technical debt by layer and workflow
3. Monitor audit progress
4. Identify orphaned files
5. Track JIRA ticket status (if TASK044 is completed)

## Tasks

### 1. Requirements and Design (High Priority)

- [ ] Define detailed dashboard requirements:
  - [ ] Key metrics to visualize
  - [ ] User personas and needs
  - [ ] Required filters and views
- [ ] Evaluate dashboard technology options:
  - [ ] Supabase UI capabilities
  - [ ] Custom web application frameworks
  - [ ] Existing BI tool integration
- [ ] Create dashboard wireframes and mockups
- [ ] Finalize technology choice and architecture

### 2. Core Dashboard Development (High Priority)

- [ ] Set up the dashboard framework
- [ ] Implement database connectivity
- [ ] Create core visualizations:
  - [ ] Files by layer chart
  - [ ] Technical debt overview
  - [ ] Audit progress tracker
- [ ] Implement filtering and sorting capabilities
- [ ] Create user authentication/authorization (if required)

### 3. Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Implement workflow-specific views
- [ ] Add technical debt tracking visuals
- [ ] Create audit progress tracking
- [ ] Implement orphaned file detection visualization
- [ ] Add JIRA integration (if TASK044 is completed)

### 4. Deployment and Documentation (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Deploy the dashboard to appropriate environment
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Document dashboard architecture and data sources
- [ ] Create maintenance guidelines
- [ ] Conduct user training

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard provides visualizations for all key metrics:
   - Files by layer
   - Technical debt by layer
   - Audit progress
   - Workflow distribution
2. Users can filter and sort data by various criteria
3. Dashboard updates in real-time as database changes
4. Authentication and authorization are properly implemented
5. Dashboard is responsive and works on mobile devices
6. Documentation is complete and comprehensive

## Resources

- Supabase File Audit database
- Standard SQL queries from `database_queries.sql`
- User personas and requirements
- ScraperSky UI design guidelines

## Dependencies

- Completion of TASK_SS_008 (Implement File Audit System)
- Ideally, completion of TASK_SS_009 (JIRA Integration Part 2) for ticket visualization

## Notes

The dashboard should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future metrics and visualizations to be added as the File Audit System evolves. Consider implementing an API layer between the dashboard and the database to facilitate future integrations.
