# Work Order: Tool Integration and Documentation

**Work Order ID:** WO_TASK_SS_011_ToolIntegrationDoc
**Related Task ID in tasks.yml:** TASK_SS_011
**Date Created:** 2025-05-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 2 days
**Status:** Open
**Assigned To:** TBD

## Background

The Supabase File Audit System (TASK042) has established a comprehensive database of all Python files in the ScraperSky backend and created several utility tools for interacting with this data. To ensure these tools are accessible and usable by all team members, we need to integrate them into the developer workflow and create comprehensive documentation.

## Objectives

1. Create comprehensive documentation for all File Audit System tools
2. Develop consistent command-line interfaces for common operations
3. Integrate tools into the developer workflow
4. Create examples and usage guidelines for all tools

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

1. Standardize the interface and options for all tools
2. Create a unified command-line interface for all file audit operations
3. Implement developer workflow hooks (pre-commit, etc.) where appropriate
4. Ensure consistent error handling and reporting across all tools

### Documentation Requirements

1. Create a comprehensive user guide for the File Audit System
2. Document all available tools with examples
3. Create a developer guide for extending the system
4. Document integration points with other systems (database, JIRA, etc.)

## Tasks

### 1. Tool Standardization (High Priority)

- [ ] Review all existing tools:
  - [ ] `file_discovery.py`
  - [ ] `generate_file_registry.py`
  - [ ] SQL queries in `database_queries.sql`
  - [ ] File header template in `file_header_template.py`
- [ ] Standardize command-line interfaces and options
- [ ] Create a unified help system across all tools
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling and reporting

### 2. Command-line Interface Development (High Priority)

- [ ] Create a unified CLI for all file audit operations:
  - [ ] `file_audit discover` - Find orphaned and phantom files
  - [ ] `file_audit register` - Register new files in the database
  - [ ] `file_audit report` - Generate reports from the database
  - [ ] `file_audit export` - Export database to YAML files
  - [ ] `file_audit verify` - Verify file header compliance
- [ ] Implement argument parsing and validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for CLI functionality

### 3. Developer Workflow Integration (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create git hooks for file audit operations:
  - [ ] Pre-commit hook to verify file headers
  - [ ] Post-commit hook to check for new files
- [ ] Implement IDE integration guidelines
- [ ] Create scripts for batch operations
- [ ] Document workflow integration options

### 4. Documentation Creation (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create a comprehensive user guide:
  - [ ] System overview
  - [ ] Tool usage instructions
  - [ ] Common workflows
  - [ ] Troubleshooting
- [ ] Create a developer guide:
  - [ ] Architecture overview
  - [ ] Extension points
  - [ ] Best practices
  - [ ] Testing guidelines
- [ ] Document all APIs and interfaces
- [ ] Create examples for common scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All tools have a consistent, documented interface
2. Unified CLI provides access to all file audit operations
3. Developer workflow hooks are implemented and documented
4. Comprehensive documentation is available for all aspects of the system
5. Examples and usage guidelines are provided for all tools

## Resources

- Existing File Audit System tools
- Internal documentation standards
- Git hook documentation
- Developer workflow documentation

## Dependencies

- Completion of TASK042 (Supabase File Audit System Implementation)
- Completion of TASK043 (File Discovery and Orphan Resolution)
- Ideally, completion of TASK044 (JIRA Integration) to document integration points

## Notes

Documentation should follow the ScraperSky documentation standards and be integrated with the existing developer guides. Tools should be designed with extensibility in mind to accommodate future enhancements and integrations.
