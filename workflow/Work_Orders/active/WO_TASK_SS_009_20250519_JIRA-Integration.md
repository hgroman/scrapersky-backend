# Work Order: JIRA Integration for File Audit System

**Work Order ID:** WO_TASK_SS_009_JIRAIntegration
**Related Task ID in tasks.yml:** TASK_SS_009
**Date Created:** 2025-05-19
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days
**Status:** In Progress (Phase 1 Complete)
**Assigned To:** TBD

## Background

The Supabase File Audit System (TASK042) has established a comprehensive database of all Python files in the ScraperSky backend, including technical debt tracking capabilities. To enhance our workflow and ensure technical debt is properly addressed, we need to integrate this system with our JIRA issue tracking platform.

## Objectives

1. Create a bidirectional synchronization between the File Audit System and JIRA
2. Ensure all technical debt identified in the file_audit table is properly tracked in JIRA
3. Update the file_audit table when JIRA tickets are resolved
4. Provide tools for creating and updating JIRA tickets based on file audit data

## Progress Summary (as of 2025-05-19)

- JIRA API integration script (`tools/jira_sync.py`) created
- Dynamic project key and issue type discovery implemented
- Atlassian Document Format (ADF) for descriptions implemented
- Successful creation of JIRA issue (CCS-7)
- Docker and environment variable integration complete
- Error handling and logging in place

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- [x] Develop a Python script to synchronize data between Supabase and JIRA
- [x] Use the JIRA REST API for all interactions
- [x] Implement secure credential management for API access
- [x] Create a bidirectional sync mechanism: (Phase 1: one-way, Phase 2: bidirectional)
  - [x] File Audit System → JIRA: Create tickets for technical debt (Phase 1: tested with sample doc)
  - [ ] JIRA → File Audit System: Update status when tickets are resolved
- [x] Provide tools for creating and updating JIRA tickets based on file audit data (Phase 1: basic tool)

### Documentation Requirements

- [x] Document the API integration approach
- [x] Provide usage instructions for all synchronization tools
- [x] Document the mapping between file_audit fields and JIRA issue fields (in progress)

## Next Steps

- Implement full bidirectional sync
- Map file_audit fields to JIRA fields
- Add automation/scheduling and reporting
- Continue documentation and testing

## Related Artifacts

- **Task:** TASK_SS_009
- **Journal Entries:** (see workflow/Journal/JE_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_TASK_SS_009_JIRA-Integration-Progress.md - exact filename needs verification)
- **Handoff:** (see workflow/Handoff/HO_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_TASK_SS_009_JIRA-Integration-Phase1.md - exact filename needs verification)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All technical debt in the file_audit table has corresponding JIRA tickets
2. Changes to JIRA ticket status are reflected in the file_audit table
3. Synchronization occurs automatically at scheduled intervals
4. Manual synchronization tools are available and documented
5. Secure credential management is implemented
6. Complete documentation is provided

## Status

**Phase 1 Complete:** JIRA integration script operational, JIRA issue creation successful.
**Phase 2:** Bidirectional sync, field mapping, and automation pending.

## Resources

- JIRA REST API documentation
- Supabase File Audit database schema
- Existing technical debt data in file_audit table

## Dependencies

- Completion of TASK042 (Supabase File Audit System Implementation)
- Completion of TASK043 (File Discovery and Orphan Resolution)
- Access to JIRA instance and API credentials

## Notes

The integration should be designed to minimize API calls and handle rate limiting appropriately. The JIRA integration should be configurable to accommodate potential changes in the JIRA project structure or issue types.
