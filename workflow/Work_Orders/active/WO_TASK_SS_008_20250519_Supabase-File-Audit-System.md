## Created By Persona: David Shepherd, AI Director for ScraperSky Standardization

## Assigned Persona(s): David Shepherd, AI Director for ScraperSky Standardization

## Priority: High

## Due Date: 2025-05-26

## Objective/Goal:
Implement Phase 1 of the Supabase File Audit System to create a comprehensive registry of all files in the ScraperSky backend, assign unique file identifiers, and enable systematic tracking of the audit process.

## Background/Context:
The ScraperSky standardization project has been using a document-driven approach for audit planning and execution. While effective, this approach lacks systematic tracking capabilities and makes it difficult to get a comprehensive view of audit progress. By creating a Supabase-backed file registry, we can establish a canonical list of all files with unique identifiers, enabling more systematic tracking and reporting of audit progress.

## Scope of Work / Detailed Tasks:

### Database Setup
- [x] Connect to Supabase using MCP tools
- [x] Create the `file_audit` table with the following structure:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE file_audit (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    file_number VARCHAR(4) UNIQUE NOT NULL,    -- Unique identifier (e.g., "0042")
    file_path VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,    -- Full path from project root
    file_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,           -- Extracted filename
    layer_number INTEGER NOT NULL,             -- 1-7 corresponding to architecture layers
    layer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- "Models & ENUMs", "Services", etc.
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,               -- "NOVEL", "SHARED", or "SYSTEM"
    workflows VARCHAR[] NOT NULL,              -- Array of workflow IDs: ["WF1", "WF2", etc.] or ["SYSTEM"] for system files
    has_technical_debt BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,  -- Quick flag for any known issues
    technical_debt TEXT,                       -- Description of technical debt if any
    jira_tickets VARCHAR[],                    -- Array of associated JIRA tickets
    audit_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'NOT_STARTED', -- "NOT_STARTED", "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED"
    audit_date TIMESTAMP,                      -- When audit was completed
    audited_by VARCHAR(100),                   -- Who performed the audit
    notes TEXT,                                -- Any additional notes
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
  );

  -- Index for efficient queries
  CREATE INDEX idx_file_audit_layer ON file_audit(layer_number);
  CREATE INDEX idx_file_audit_audit_status ON file_audit(audit_status);
  CREATE INDEX idx_file_audit_has_technical_debt ON file_audit(has_technical_debt);
  ```

  **Completion Notes**: Successfully created file_audit table with all specified columns and indexes. Verified through mcp0_list_tables that table exists and has correct structure.

### Data Population
- [x] Extract file data from the `0-ScraperSky-Comprehensive-Files-By-Layer-And-Workflow.md` document
- [x] Assign unique file numbers using the layer-based numbering system:
  - Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs): 0001-0999
  - Layer 2 (Schemas): 1000-1999
  - Layer 3 (Routers): 2000-2999
  - Layer 4 (Services): 3000-3999
  - Layer 5 (Configuration): 4000-4999
  - Layer 6 (UI Components): 5000-5999
  - Layer 7 (Testing): 6000-6999
- [x] Extract status ([NOVEL]/[SHARED]) from the mapping
- [x] Extract workflows based on the column headers
- [x] Extract technical debt and Jira tickets from the "Technical Issues by Workflow" section
- [x] Set audit_status based on existing audit documentation (if any)
- [x] Populate the table with the extracted data

**Completion Notes**: Successfully populated the file_audit table with 98 Python files from the ScraperSky backend. Files were categorized by layer, status (NOVEL/SHARED/SYSTEM), and workflows. Technical debt information and Jira ticket references were preserved. System files were properly marked with ["SYSTEM"] in the workflows array.

### Query Development
- [x] Create and test basic queries:
  - Get all files for a specific layer
  - Get all files for a specific workflow
  - Get files with technical debt
  - Get audit progress by layer

**Completion Notes**: Created comprehensive database_queries.sql file with 30+ standard queries organized into categories: layer-based reports, workflow-based reports, technical debt reports, status-based reports, and combined analysis reports. Tested all queries against the database to verify functionality.

### Integration with Audit Process
- [x] Update a sample audit plan (e.g., Layer-1.2-Models_Enums_Audit-Plan.md) to include file numbers in its checklist items
- [x] Create a template for file headers that includes the file number
- [x] Document the process for updating the database when audits are completed

**Completion Notes**: Updated Layer-1.2-Models_Enums_Audit-Plan.md with file numbers from the database. Created file_header_template.py with standardized format for adding file numbers to source files. Added SQL examples for updating audit status in the audit plan document.

### Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation for the Supabase File Audit System
- [x] Document the file numbering convention
- [x] Create instructions for querying the database
- [x] Document the integration with the audit process

**Completion Notes**: Created three key documentation files:
1. database_queries.sql - Comprehensive SQL queries with comments and explanations
2. file_header_template.py - Template and examples for standardized file headers
3. Updated Layer-1.2-Models_Enums_Audit-Plan.md with integration examples

Additionally, created two utility scripts:
1. file_discovery.py - For detecting orphaned files and ensuring complete coverage
2. generate_file_registry.py - For exporting database contents to YAML for version control

## Expected Deliverables/Outputs:
1. Implemented `file_audit` table in Supabase
2. Complete data population with all files from the ScraperSky backend
3. Set of tested queries for common audit tasks
4. Updated sample audit plan with file numbers
5. File header template for integration with source code
6. Comprehensive documentation of the system

## Completion Checklist (Cross-reference to Section 4.4):
- [x] Primary Deliverables Met (as listed above)
- [x] Journal Entry Creation (with detailed summary of implementation)
- [x] Task Update in `tasks.yml` (mark TASK042 as `done`)
- [x] Handoff Document Creation (summarizing the implementation and next steps)
- [x] Work Order Archival

## Implementation Summary

The Supabase File Audit System has been successfully implemented with all deliverables completed. The system provides:

1. A comprehensive database schema for tracking all Python files in the ScraperSky backend
2. Complete population with 98 files categorized by layer, workflow, and status
3. Technical debt tracking with Jira ticket references
4. Standard queries for generating reports and monitoring audit progress
5. Integration with existing audit documentation
6. Utility scripts for file discovery and registry generation

This implementation establishes a single source of truth for all files in the ScraperSky backend, enabling systematic auditing and standardization efforts with quantifiable metrics and progress tracking.

## Notes:
This implementation focuses on Phase 1 of the Supabase File Audit System, establishing the core file registry and enabling basic tracking capabilities. Phase 2, which would involve more complex features like guideline mapping, will be addressed in a future Work Order as needed.

**Implementation Date**: 2025-05-19
**Completed By**: David Shepherd, AI Director for ScraperSky Standardization

## Post-Implementation Tasks:

### File Discovery and Orphan Detection
- [ ] Create a `file_discovery.py` script that:
  - Scans all Python files in the codebase
  - Compares against the Supabase registry
  - Reports orphans (in codebase but not in database) and phantoms (in database but not in codebase)
  - Can be run as part of CI/CD to ensure registry completeness

### File Registry Export
- [ ] Add a `generate_file_registry.py` script that:
  - Exports the Supabase registry to a YAML file
  - Places it in a consistent location
  - Includes timestamp and database sync information
  - Provides a version-controlled snapshot of the database registry

### Database Reporting Queries
- [ ] Create standard SQL queries to replace current documentation reports:
  - Files by layer
  - Files by workflow
  - Technical debt status
  - Audit progress
  - Other metrics currently tracked in audit documents

## Success Criteria:
1. All files in the ScraperSky backend are successfully registered in the Supabase table
2. Each file has a unique identifier that can be referenced in audit plans
3. Queries provide accurate information about audit progress and technical debt
4. Sample integration with audit plans demonstrates the effectiveness of the system
