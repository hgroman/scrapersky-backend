### CRITICAL SEVERITY ISSUES (25 instances)

**Anti-Pattern:** Manual `await session.commit()` or `await session.rollback()` inside context managers that already handle transaction lifecycle

**Files Affected:**
1. **src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler_fixed.py**
   - Line 125: `await session.commit()`
   - Line 187: `await session.commit()`  
   - Line 193: `await session.rollback()`
   - **Impact:** Experimental/testing file - verify if production code

2. **src/services/page_scraper/domain_processor.py**
   - Line 172: `await session.commit()  # Commit the insert attempt`
   - Line 192: `await session.rollback()  # Rollback on insert error`
   - **Impact:** Page scraping operations may create idle connections

3. **src/session/async_session_fixed.py**
   - Line 95: `await session.commit()  # Manual commit when ready`
   - Line 118: `await session.commit()  # Explicit commit`
   - **Impact:** Experimental session handling - verify purpose

4. **src/tasks/email_scraper.py** - **PRODUCTION CODE**
   - Line 318: `await session.commit()  # Commit RUNNING status`
   - Line 388: `await session.commit()`
   - Line 411: `await session.commit()`
   - Line 416: `await session.rollback()  # Rollback if final commit fails`
   - Line 442: `session.commit()`
   - Line 448: `await session.rollback()`
   - **Impact:** Email scanning tasks creating idle database connections

### HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES (4 instances)

**Anti-Pattern:** Session creation without context managers leading to potential connection leaks

**Files Affected:**
1. **src/db/session.py**
   - Line 284: `session = async_session_factory()`
   - Line 360: `session = async_session_factory()`

2. **src/session/async_session.py**
   - Line 260: `session = async_session_factory()`

### MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES (4 instances)

**Anti-Pattern:** Potential session leaks and performance issues

**Files Affected:**
1. **src/db/session.py**
   - Line 303: Session operations inside loop pattern

2. **src/session/async_session.py**
   - Line 201: Background task session without context manager
   - Line 220: Background task session factory pattern
   - Line 235: Session creation pattern

## üö® BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Workflows Affected
- **WF2 (Deep Scans):** Background processors may leak connections
- **WF3 (Domain Extraction):** Session management in processing loops  
- **WF4 (Domain Curation):** Already fixed, but similar patterns elsewhere
- **WF5 (Sitemap Import):** Background job session handling
- **Email Scanning Tasks:** Production email scraper has multiple violations
- **Page Scraping Operations:** Domain processor has transaction violations

### Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK:** Same "idle in transaction" pattern that broke WF4 exists in 24+ other locations
**SYSTEM-WIDE IMPACT:** Any of these locations could block database UPDATE operations
**SILENT FAILURES:** Anti-patterns create hard-to-debug hanging operations
**PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION:** Connection pool exhaustion from leaked sessions

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Current Anti-Pattern (INCORRECT)
```python
# WRONG: Manual transaction management inside context manager
async with get_background_session() as session:
    # Perform database operations
    result = await session.execute(stmt)
    await session.commit()  # ‚ùå CREATES IDLE IN TRANSACTION CONNECTION
```

### Required Pattern (CORRECT)
```python
# CORRECT: Let context manager handle transaction lifecycle
async with get_background_session() as session:
    # Perform database operations  
    result = await session.execute(stmt)
    # ‚úÖ Context manager handles commit/rollback automatically
```

### Session Management Standards
Following documented patterns in:
- `Docs/Docs_1_AI_Guides/07-LAYER5_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STANDARDS.md`
- `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/13-LAYER5_TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`
