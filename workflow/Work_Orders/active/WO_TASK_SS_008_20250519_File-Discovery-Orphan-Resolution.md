# Work Order: File Discovery and Orphan Resolution

**Work Order ID:** WO_TASK_SS_008_FileDiscovery
**Related Task ID in tasks.yml:** TASK_SS_008
**Date Created:** 2025-05-19
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Status:** Open
**Assigned To:** TBD

## Background

The Supabase File Audit System has been successfully implemented (TASK042), providing a comprehensive database-driven approach to tracking all Python files in the ScraperSky backend. To ensure the integrity of this system, we need to perform a thorough file discovery process to identify any discrepancies between the codebase and the database registry.

## Objectives

1. Identify all "orphaned" Python files (files that exist in the codebase but not in the database)
2. Identify all "phantom" files (files listed in the database but not found in the codebase)
3. Resolve all discrepancies by updating the database registry
4. Document the process and findings

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements

1. Use the existing `file_discovery.py` script to scan the codebase and compare with database
2. Enhance the script as needed to provide better reporting and resolution options
3. Create SQL queries to update the database with any missing files
4. Ensure all files have proper layer, status, and workflow assignments

### Documentation Requirements

1. Update the file registry YAML exports after all changes
2. Document any patterns found in orphaned files
3. Create a report of all changes made to the database

## Tasks

### 1. Initial Discovery (High Priority)

- [ ] Run the existing `file_discovery.py` script to identify orphaned and phantom files
- [ ] Generate a comprehensive report of findings
- [ ] Categorize orphaned files by directory pattern and potential layer

### 2. Analysis and Categorization (High Priority)

- [ ] Review each orphaned file to determine:
  - [ ] Appropriate layer assignment
  - [ ] Status (NOVEL, SHARED, or SYSTEM)
  - [ ] Associated workflows (if any)
  - [ ] Potential technical debt
- [ ] Review each phantom file to determine if it should be removed from the registry

### 3. Database Updates (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Create SQL queries to add orphaned files to the database
- [ ] Create SQL queries to remove or mark phantom files
- [ ] Update the database with all changes
- [ ] Verify the updates with a second run of `file_discovery.py`

### 4. Documentation and Reporting (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Update the file registry YAML exports
- [ ] Create a summary report of findings and changes
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation with new file counts and statistics
- [ ] Document any patterns or issues discovered for future reference

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Zero orphaned Python files after completion (all files in the codebase are registered)
2. Zero unexplained phantom files in the database
3. Complete documentation of all changes made
4. Updated file registry YAML exports
5. Final report with statistics and findings

## Resources

- `file_discovery.py` - Tool for identifying orphaned and phantom files
- `generate_file_registry.py` - Tool for exporting the database to YAML
- `database_queries.sql` - Standard SQL queries for the file audit system
- Supabase File Audit database

## Dependencies

- Completion of TASK042 (Supabase File Audit System Implementation)
- Access to Supabase database

## Notes

This work is essential for ensuring the integrity of the File Audit System. Without a complete and accurate registry, future efforts like JIRA integration and dashboard development will be built on an incomplete foundation.
