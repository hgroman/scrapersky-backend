## üéØ FLIGHT PLAN SUMMARY

**Work Order ID:** WO_TASK_WF4_001  
**Title:** Enhanced Processing Reporting for WF4 Domain Curation  
**Status:** Open  
**Related Task ID in DART:** lnUgr8O0kaCO ([Enhanced Processing Reporting for WF4 Domain Curation](https://app.dartai.com/t/lnUgr8O0kaCO-Enhanced-Processing-Reporting))  

**Objective/Goal:** Implement comprehensive reporting capabilities for domain sitemap discovery and processing results, addressing current visibility gaps where successfully processed domains with zero sitemaps found provide no actionable insights.

**Background/Context:** During production debugging on 2025-07-31, it was discovered that domains like knotts.com are processed successfully but find no sitemaps, leaving operators with no visibility into what happened. The system currently treats "no sitemaps found" identically to "successfully found sitemaps" with a simple "submitted" status, creating a major reporting blind spot.

## üìã SCOPE OF WORK / DETAILED TASKS

### Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement
- [ ] Add result tracking columns to domains table:
  - `sitemap_discovery_result` (JSONB) - Detailed discovery outcomes
  - `sitemap_count` (INTEGER) - Number of sitemaps found
  - `discovery_duration_ms` (INTEGER) - Processing time metrics
  - `last_discovery_attempt` (TIMESTAMP) - For retry tracking

- [ ] Create sitemap_discovery_attempts table:
  - Track each URL attempted during discovery
  - Record response codes, timeouts, and error messages
  - Enable pattern analysis for failed discoveries

### Phase 2: Processing Service Updates
- [ ] Enhance domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py:
  - Capture detailed discovery metrics during processing
  - Store attempt results in new data structures
  - Differentiate between successful discoveries with/without results

- [ ] Update sitemap_analyzer.py:
  - Return structured discovery results object
  - Include all attempted URLs and their outcomes
  - Provide actionable recommendations for failed discoveries

### Phase 3: API & Reporting Endpoints
- [ ] Create new reporting endpoints:
  - `/api/v3/domains/discovery-summary` - Aggregate statistics
  - `/api/v3/domains/{id}/discovery-details` - Individual domain report
  - `/api/v3/domains/discovery-failures` - Domains needing attention

- [ ] Enhance existing domain listing endpoint:
  - Include sitemap_count in response
  - Add discovery_status filter options
  - Support sorting by discovery metrics

### Phase 4: UI Enhancements
- [ ] Update Domain Curation UI:
  - Show sitemap count badge next to domain status
  - Add "View Discovery Details" action for each domain
  - Implement discovery status filters (Has Sitemaps/No Sitemaps/Failed)

- [ ] Create Discovery Dashboard:
  - Aggregate metrics visualization
  - Failed discovery queue for manual review
  - Processing time trends and performance metrics

### Phase 5: Documentation & Training
- [ ] Update WF4 Guardian documentation with new reporting features
- [ ] Create operator guide for interpreting discovery results
- [ ] Document common failure patterns and remediation steps

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Functional Requirements
- Operators can immediately see which domains have sitemaps vs. which don't
- Failed discovery attempts provide actionable error messages
- Discovery patterns are trackable for system optimization

### Performance Requirements
- Reporting adds <100ms overhead to processing pipeline
- Dashboard loads discovery summary in <2 seconds
- Historical data retention for 90 days minimum

### Quality Metrics

## üìù NOTES

This work order addresses a critical visibility gap discovered during production debugging. The lack of discovery reporting has been identified as a significant operational challenge that affects the ability to:

1. Diagnose why domains aren't finding sitemaps
2. Identify patterns in sitemap discovery failures
3. Provide operators with actionable next steps
4. Track system performance and optimization opportunities

The implementation should follow established patterns from recent WF4 fixes and maintain the high reliability standards established during the 2025-07-31 debugging session.
