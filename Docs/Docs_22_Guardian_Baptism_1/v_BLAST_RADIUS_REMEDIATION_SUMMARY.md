# Blast Radius Remediation: Service & Router Layer Summary

## 1. Introduction: The Ripple Effect

This document is a companion to the `LAYER_1_REMEDIATION_SUMMARY.md`. While the first summary focused on correcting the data foundation (Layer 1), this document details the "blast radius"â€”the ripple effect of those changes on higher layers, specifically the Service (Layer 3) and Router (Layer 4) layers.

Refactoring a foundational layer is like pulling up the roots of a tree; it inevitably disturbs the ground around it. The objective of this phase was to meticulously identify and remediate every point of impact, ensuring that the application as a whole was brought into alignment with the new, stable foundation. This process was critical for ensuring that no broken references or architectural inconsistencies were left behind.

## 2. Phase 1: Service Layer Remediation

**Challenge:** The immediate impact of centralizing ENUMs into `src/models/enums.py` was that service-layer files, which contained business logic, were left referencing old, decentralized ENUMs. This broke their data contracts and would have caused runtime failures.

**Anti-Pattern Identified:**
-   **Decentralized ENUM Dependency:** Services depended on ENUMs defined within specific model files (e.g., `from src.models.sitemap import SitemapImportCurationStatusEnum`). This created a tight coupling and made the services vulnerable to any change in the model layer.

**Remediation Strategy & Affected Files:**

A targeted `grep` search was used to locate all imports of the old ENUMs within the `src/services` directory. The following files were identified and remediated:

1.  `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py`
2.  `src/services/domain_scheduler.py`
3.  `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`

**Action Taken:** All incorrect import statements were updated to point to the new single source of truth. For example:

-   **Before:** `from src.models.sitemap import SitemapImportCurationStatusEnum`
-   **After:** `from src.models.enums import SitemapImportCurationStatus`

This simple but critical change decoupled the services from the specifics of any single model file, making them dependent only on the abstract, application-wide ENUM definitions.

## 3. Phase 2: Router & Schema Layer Remediation

**Challenge:** The Router layer presented a more complex set of architectural violations. It suffered from the same ENUM dependency issues as the service layer, but was also plagued by misplaced schemas and redundant logic.

**Anti-Patterns Identified:**
1.  **The `api_models.py` Monolith:** A single file in the `models` layer was used as a dumping ground for Pydantic schemas from multiple, unrelated domains. This violated the separation of concerns between data models (Layer 1) and data schemas (Layer 2).
2.  **In-File Schemas:** Routers often contained their own local Pydantic schema definitions, making them non-reusable and tightly coupling the API endpoint to its data shape.
3.  **Fragile ENUM Mapping:** Routers contained brittle logic to manually map API-layer ENUMs to database-layer ENUMs, a clear symptom of decentralized ENUM definitions.

**Remediation Strategy & Affected Files:**
The remediation was a comprehensive refactoring of the entire router and schema architecture.

1.  **Schema Migration:**
    -   A new `src/schemas` directory was established as the canonical location for all Pydantic models.
    -   Schemas were systematically moved out of `api_models.py` and router files into new, domain-specific files within `src/schemas`.

2.  **Router Refactoring:**
    -   All router files were updated to import their schemas from `src/schemas` and their ENUMs from `src/models/enums.py`.
    -   All redundant ENUM mapping logic was removed, as the API now uses the same centralized ENUMs as the database layer.

**Affected Files & Artifacts:**

-   **Routers Remediated:**
    -   `src/routers/sitemap_files.py`
    -   `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py`
    -   `src/routers/domains.py`
    -   `src/routers/local_businesses.py`

-   **Schemas Migrated/Created in `src/schemas`:**
    -   `src/schemas/sitemap_file.py`
    -   `src/schemas/domain.py`
    -   `src/schemas/local_business.py`

-   **Decommissioned File:**
    -   `src/models/api_models.py` (deleted after all dependencies were eliminated).

## 4. Conclusion: A Stable Superstructure

By systematically tracing the blast radius from Layer 1 up through the Service and Router layers, we have ensured end-to-end architectural integrity. The application is now fully decoupled, with clear boundaries and responsibilities for each layer. This effort has not only fixed existing issues but has also fortified the codebase against future entropy, ensuring that the principles outlined in the `ARCHITECTURAL_BLUEPRINT.md` are reflected in the implementation.
