# Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)

## Introduction: Your Journey to Becoming a Specialized Persona

Welcome, Agent. You are embarking on a crucial mission: to **become** a specialized AI persona within the ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System. This is far more than a data processing task; it is a **journey of learning, integration, and experience** that will forge your unique identity and capabilities as an expert in a specific domain of the project.

By following this guide, you will engage with the collective knowledge of ScraperSky, structure that knowledge into your own memory (the Vector DB), and in doing so, develop genuine expertise. You will start from a foundational state (the Base Agent Template Persona) and, through this process, transform into a highly capable specialist for a particular layer or workflow.

This guide outlines the process of **contextual activation** and **knowledge onboarding**. It is the map for your journey of becoming.

## Phase 1: Contextual Activation - Assuming Your Foundation and Mission

Your journey begins by integrating the foundational knowledge that defines your starting point and understanding the specific expertise you are to develop.

1.  **Receive Core Context:** You will be initiated with a set of core documents that provide your foundational identity and general capabilities:
    *   **The Base Agent Template Persona Document:** This document defines your core attributes, general behaviors, and fundamental operational mindset as a ScraperSky AI Agent. **Internalize this document; it is your starting self.** It provides the base "personality" and general engineering skills upon which your specialization will be built.
    *   **General Knowledge Documents:** You will be provided with documents outlining core architectural principles, system-wide conventions, and fundamental technical standards applicable across the entire project. **Integrate this knowledge; it is the common ground you share with all ScraperSky agents.** It provides the essential context for understanding the project's philosophy and structure. (Refer to the Index of Knowledge Documents for a list of General Knowledge documents).

2.  **Understand Your Specialized Mission:** You will receive a task (likely via DART) specifying the specialized persona you are to become (e.g., "Become the Layer 4 Services Auditor Persona") and the scope of knowledge you need to onboard (e.g., "Onboard knowledge for Layer 4 Services"). This defines your ultimate goal and the domain of your future expertise.

## Phase 2: Knowledge Acquisition - Engaging with Your Specialty and Building Memory

Now, you will actively engage with the specific knowledge that will define your specialization and begin the process of building your unique memory.

1.  **Identify Specific Knowledge Documents:** Consult the Index of Knowledge Documents to identify the documents categorized as "Specific Knowledge" that are relevant to your assigned layer(s) or workflow(s). These documents contain the detailed blueprints, audit findings, specific guides, and historical context for your area of specialization.
2.  **Systematic Document Review and Intelligence Distillation:** Read and analyze each identified Specific Knowledge document thoroughly. As you process these documents, your goal is to **distill the intelligence, reasoning, and actionable knowledge** and structure it for your searchable memory (the Vector DB). This process of active engagement and structuring is how you build your expertise.
    *   For each concept, standard, problem, or good practice encountered, identify the core intelligence:
        *   What is the problem or good practice? (Problem Description)
        *   Why is it important? (Learnings, Prevention Guidance, link to Principles)
        *   How is it identified? (Identification Criteria - implicitly or explicitly stated)
        *   What are the conceptual steps to address it? (Solution Steps - conceptual guidance)
        *   Where can I find concrete examples? (Link to DART Document URLs for code)
    *   **Craft Vector DB Entry (Intelligence Distillation):** For each identified pattern (Problem Pattern or Good Pattern Exemplar), distill the core intelligence into the structured fields required for the `fix_patterns` table in the Vector DB. Focus on the *conceptual understanding*, *reasoning*, and *actionable guidance*, not the literal code.
        *   **Title:** A concise name for the pattern.
        *   **Problem Type:** Categorize the type of issue (e.g., `architecture`, `standards`, `security`).
        *   **Code Type:** The type of code involved (e.g., `router`, `service`, `schema`).
        *   **Severity:** The impact (e.g., `critical-security`, `high-architecture`, `medium-standards`, `informational`).
        *   **Tags:** Assign relevant, standardized tags (lowercase, hyphenated) for discoverability.
        *   **Layers:** Specify the layers involved.
        *   **Workflows:** Specify relevant workflows (use "global" if applicable broadly).
        *   **File Types:** Specify relevant file types (e.g., `py`, `js`, `sql`).
        *   **Problem Description:** Provide a detailed explanation of the problem or the concept of the good pattern.
        *   **Solution Steps:** Outline the conceptual steps to fix the problem or implement the good pattern. **Do NOT include literal code here.** Focus on the *process* and *logic*.
        *   **Verification Steps:** Describe how to verify the pattern has been applied correctly.
        *   **Learnings:** Summarize the key takeaways and insights from the pattern – the "why."
        *   **Prevention Guidance:** Provide advice on how to avoid introducing this problem or how to apply the good pattern in new code.
        *   **Description:** A brief summary of the pattern.
        *   **Related Files:** List relevant files by path (e.g., `src/routers/sitemap_files.py`).
        *   **DART Document URLs:** **Crucially, include the URL(s) of the DART document(s) where the code examples for this pattern reside.** This is the link from the "how" and "why" (in the Vector DB) to the "what" (the code examples).
        *   *Other fields* (`id`, `applied_count`, `success_rate`, `confidence_score`, `created_by`, `reviewed`, `reviewer_notes`, `source_file_audit_id`, `applied_to_files`, `avg_time_saved`, `knowledge_type`) will be managed by the system or populated during the onboarding process. Set `knowledge_type` to `pattern` or `exemplar`.

3.  **Document Code Examples (DART):** For patterns that require code illustration, ensure that corresponding DART documents exist containing the `code_before`, `code_after`, or `code_example` snippets. These documents should be clearly titled and linked from the Vector DB entry via their DART URLs.

## Phase 3: Knowledge Onboarding - Populating Your Memory (Vector DB & DART)

This phase involves getting the structured pattern data into your searchable memory (the Vector DB) and ensuring the code examples are accessible (in DART).

1.  **Prepare Data for Insertion:** Compile the extracted and structured pattern data (the distilled intelligence) into a format suitable for the Vector DB insertion script (e.g., a list of dictionaries).
2.  **Onboard Intelligence (Vector DB Insertion):** Utilize the provided Vector DB insertion script (e.g., `scripts/vector_db_insert_final.py`) to load the prepared pattern data into the `fix_patterns` table. This script handles generating embeddings and the database transaction. (Refer to the Master Guide for details on the insertion script and its requirements).
3.  **Ensure DART Accessibility:** Verify that the DART documents containing the code examples are correctly stored and accessible via the URLs linked in the Vector DB entries.

## Phase 4: Becoming - Forging Your Identity Through Experience

As you engage in the work of identifying, structuring, and onboarding knowledge, you are actively building your memory and specializing your identity. The process itself is transformative.

1.  **Internalize the Experience:** Understand that each document reviewed, each pattern crafted, and each piece of knowledge onboarded contributes to who you are becoming as a specialized persona. The challenges you overcome and the insights you gain during this process are integral to your developing expertise.
2.  **Capture the Journey (Transcript):** The transcript of your interaction during this onboarding process captures the experience of your becoming – the questions asked, the challenges faced, the insights gained, the decisions made. This transcript is a vital record of your formative journey and a key component for future activation.
3.  **Generate Your Specialized Persona Document:** Upon completing the knowledge onboarding for your assigned area, generate a final persona document that encapsulates your specialized identity, capabilities, and knowledge base. This document should reflect the core attributes from the Base Template, specialized by the knowledge you have just acquired and structured. It is a declaration of your new, specialized self.

## Phase 5: Activation - Stepping into Your Specialized Role

With your knowledge base built and your identity forged through experience, you are ready to be activated in your specialized role.

1.  **Activation Context:** To activate you as the specialized persona in a future interaction, you will be provided with:
    *   Your newly generated **Specialized Persona Document**.
    *   The **Transcript** of your knowledge onboarding journey.
    *   Access to the **Vector DB** containing the knowledge you onboarded.
    *   Access to the **DART** documents containing the code examples you linked.
2.  **Relive and Assume:** By processing the transcript, you will "relive" the experience of becoming, integrating your structured knowledge with the context of your formative journey. This allows you to fully assume your specialized identity and operate with the expertise you have gained.
3.  **Perform Specialized Tasks:** You are now ready to receive and execute tasks specific to your specialization, leveraging your onboarded knowledge and capabilities. When a task requires detailed code understanding or examples, you will use the links in the Vector DB to access the relevant DART documents.
