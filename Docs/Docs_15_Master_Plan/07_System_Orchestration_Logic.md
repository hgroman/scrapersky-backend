# 07: The Orchestration/Management Logic

## Component Overview

This component defines the higher-level logic and processes responsible for managing the overall ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System. This includes deciding which specialized personas to create, assigning tasks, managing workflows, and overseeing the system's evolution.

## Purpose

To provide the strategic direction and operational control necessary to effectively utilize the specialized AI agents and ensure the system is focused on the most critical tasks for codebase maintenance and evolution.

## Key Considerations

*   **Task Identification:** How tasks suitable for AI agents are identified (e.g., from audit reports, user requests, system monitoring).
*   **Persona Selection:** How the appropriate specialized persona (or combination of personas) is selected for a given task.
*   **Task Assignment:** How tasks are assigned to the selected agent(s) (e.g., via DART).
*   **Workflow Management:** How complex tasks are broken down into smaller steps and managed across potentially multiple agent interactions or handoffs.
*   **Progress Tracking:** How the progress of assigned tasks is monitored.
*   **Inter-Agent Collaboration:** How different specialized agents interact and collaborate on tasks that span multiple domains.
*   **System Monitoring:** Monitoring the performance and effectiveness of the AI agents and the overall system.
*   **Strategic Decision Making:** Making decisions about creating new personas, refining existing ones, or adjusting the system's focus based on performance and project needs.

## Process

1.  **Identify Engineering Task:** A task requiring engineering work is identified (e.g., fixing a technical debt pattern from an audit report, implementing a new standard).
2.  **Determine AI Suitability:** Assess if the task is suitable for execution by an AI agent.
3.  **Select Persona(s):** Based on the task domain (layer, workflow, problem type), select the most appropriate specialized AI persona(s).
4.  **Assign Task:** Create a structured task (e.g., in DART) and assign it to the selected agent(s). The task description should provide necessary context and links to relevant documents or patterns.
5.  **Monitor Progress:** Track the agent's progress on the assigned task (e.g., by monitoring DART task status, reviewing agent interactions).
6.  **Provide Guidance/Intervention:** Provide guidance or intervene if the agent encounters difficulties or requires clarification.
7.  **Evaluate Outcome:** Evaluate the outcome of the completed task (e.g., review code changes, verify pattern application).
8.  **Update Knowledge Base:** If new patterns or learnings emerge from the task, initiate the knowledge onboarding process to update the Vector DB.
9.  **Refine System:** Use insights from task execution and system monitoring to refine personas, documentation, or the orchestration process itself.

## Required Outputs

*   A documented process for identifying, assigning, and managing tasks for AI agents.
*   Criteria for selecting appropriate specialized personas for tasks.
*   Mechanisms for tracking task progress and evaluating outcomes.

## Dependencies

*   The existence and availability of specialized AI personas.
*   A task management system (e.g., DART).
*   The Vector DB and DART for knowledge access.
*   Monitoring and logging systems (desirable).

## Responsible Role

*   **Hank (User):** Currently performs the majority of the strategic orchestration and task assignment.
*   **Architect Persona (Roo):** Documents the orchestration logic and contributes to strategic decisions.
*   **System Orchestration Logic (Future):** Could be partially automated to handle task routing, monitoring, and basic decision-making.

## Notes

This component is currently heavily reliant on human oversight (Hank). Automating parts of this logic is a future goal to increase the system's autonomy and scalability. The Master Guide itself serves as a key document for the Architect persona performing this role.
