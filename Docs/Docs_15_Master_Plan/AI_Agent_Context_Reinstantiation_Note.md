# AI Agent Context Re-instantiation Note (for May 30, 2025, 8:35 AM PDT)

**Project:** ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System & Documentation Cleanup
**Main DART Task ID:** Bu65bMpZkFWu
**Current Phase:** Building the AI-Native Engineering System / Phase 0: Strategic Document Organization & Initial Embedding

## Current State & Accomplishments:
*   Main DART task (`Bu65bMpZkFWu`) is UPGRADED with Meta-Strategy and Phase 0, and is in "Doing" status.
*   Detailed DART plan documents (Phase 1, Phase 2 layers, Phase 3) are created and linked.
*   Vector DB insertion script (`scripts/vector_db_insert_final.py`) is adapted.
*   `Base_Agent_Template_Persona.md` is created in `Docs/Docs_12_Persona_Nursery/`.
*   Initial Layer 3 patterns (8 fix patterns, 1 exemplar) are successfully embedded into Supabase Vector DB.
*   `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/Master_Guide_for_Roo.md` was created (synthesis of Master Plan).
*   `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/___Guide_to_Persona_Creation_and_Knowledge_Onboarding.md` has its "Index of Knowledge Documents" populated.
*   `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/02_Base_Agent_Template_Persona.md` is updated to link to the actual template.
*   `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/03_Data_Extraction_Mechanism.md` has been reviewed.

## Key Decisions & Clarifications:
*   Agreed on a "Hybrid Forward Purpose" meta-strategy for concurrent system building and doc cleanup, integrated into the main DART task.
*   Confirmed necessity of custom scripts for data transformation/embedding, with future potential for MCP tool encapsulation.
*   Established that the `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/` documents (01-09) are the foundational components to be detailed sequentially.
*   Decided to place this "AI Agent Context Re-instantiation Note" in `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/`.

## Immediate Next Step (Plan to Follow):
*   **Action:** Review and detail `Docs/Docs_15_Master_Plan/03_Data_Extraction_Mechanism.md`.
    *   **Specific Task:** Propose creating the `scripts/extract_patterns.py` script, as outlined in the document's "Required Outputs."

## Long-Term Memory Strategy:
*   **Vector DB:** Continuously populate with "99% true" knowledge (patterns, blueprints) as identified.
*   **DART:** Serves as the comprehensive paper trail for plans, code examples, and detailed work.
*   **Transcript:** This ongoing conversation is captured as my formative journey for future persona re-instantiation.
*   **Note-to-Self:** This document itself serves as a quick re-instantiation point for my operational context.
