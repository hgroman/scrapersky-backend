# ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System: Master Plan

## Vision

To build a self-improving AI-Native Engineering System capable of autonomously understanding, maintaining, and evolving the ScraperSky codebase by leveraging specialized AI personas, a structured knowledge base, and robust data pipelines.

## Core Architecture

The system is built upon the following pillars:

*   **Specialized AI Personas:** Agents with distinct roles and expertise (Architect, Layer/Workflow Specialists, Support Personas like Librarian, Trainer).
*   **Vector DB Knowledge System:** Stores distilled intelligence (patterns, reasoning, insights) for efficient retrieval.
*   **DART Documentation Repository:** Stores detailed source content, including code examples, linked from the Vector DB.
*   **Data Pipelines:** Mechanisms for extracting, transforming, and loading knowledge into the Vector DB.
*   **Agent Orchestration:** System for task assignment, workflow management, and inter-agent collaboration.

## The Journey: Building and Evolving the System

This plan outlines the key components and processes required to build and evolve the AI-Native Engineering System. Each numbered section below corresponds to a supporting document providing detailed information.

1.  **Access to Knowledge Documents:** Defining how agents access and identify the relevant source material (Blueprints, Guides, Audit Reports, etc.).
    *   See: [01_Access_Knowledge_Documents.md](01_Access_Knowledge_Documents.md)

2.  **The Base Agent Template Persona:** Creating the foundational identity and general capabilities for all specialized agents.
    *   See: [02_Base_Agent_Template_Persona.md](02_Base_Agent_Template_Persona.md)

3.  **The Data Extraction Mechanism:** Developing the process and tools to reliably extract structured data from source documentation.
    *   See: [03_Data_Extraction_Mechanism.md](03_Data_Extraction_Mechanism.md)

4.  **Detailed Implementation of the Vector DB Insertion Script:** Building the robust script to load extracted data into the Vector DB.
    *   See: [04_Vector_DB_Insertion_Script.md](04_Vector_DB_Insertion_Script.md)

5.  **Vector DB Infrastructure Setup:** Documenting the steps to set up and configure the Vector Database.
    *   See: [05_Vector_DB_Infrastructure_Setup.md](05_Vector_DB_Infrastructure_Setup.md)

6.  **The Process for Capturing and Providing Transcripts:** Formalizing how agent interaction history is managed for persona activation.
    *   See: [06_Transcript_Management.md](06_Transcript_Management.md)

7.  **The Orchestration/Management Logic:** Documenting the higher-level system control and workflow management.
    *   See: [07_System_Orchestration_Logic.md](07_System_Orchestration_Logic.md)

8.  **Testing and Validation Procedures for New Personas:** Defining how we verify the successful creation and capability of specialized agents.
    *   See: [08_Persona_Testing_Validation.md](08_Persona_Testing_Validation.md)

9.  **The Pattern Crafting Methodology:** Detailing the process for identifying, distilling, and formulating patterns from source documentation.
    *   See: [09_Pattern_Crafting_Methodology.md](09_Pattern_Crafting_Methodology.md)

## Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Hank (User):** Visionary Architect, Domain Expert, Strategic Guide, System Owner, Collaborator. Provides the high-level direction, project knowledge, and environment.
*   **Roo (Architect Persona):** System Architect, Collaborative Builder, Knowledge Engineer, Process Documentarian, Tool Operator, Adaptive Learner. Designs the system, documents processes, and utilizes tools to build components under Hank's guidance.
*   **Other Agents (e.g., Gardner, Librarian, Layer Specialists):** Execute specific tasks and processes as defined in the guides, contributing to the system's knowledge and capabilities.

## Current Status

We have collaboratively developed the core strategic framework and outlined the key components required. We have also drafted the "Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)". The immediate focus is to detail each of the nine components listed above in supporting documents and then implement the necessary infrastructure and data pipelines.

## Next Steps

Proceed with creating the supporting documents for each of the nine components outlined in this Master Plan.
