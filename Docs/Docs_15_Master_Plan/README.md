# ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System: Master Plan (Strategic Overview)

This directory now serves as the central repository for **high-level strategic and foundational documents** pertaining to the overall ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System. It provides the overarching vision, architectural principles, and strategic plans, distinct from the detailed implementation and operational guides for specific components like the Vector Database.

## Purpose:

The primary purpose of the `Master Plan (Strategic Overview)` directory is to:

1.  **Provide Overarching Strategic Context:** House the definitive blueprint for the entire AI-Native Engineering System, outlining its vision, core architecture, and major components at a strategic level.
2.  **Document Architectural Evolution:** Preserve key historical architectural decisions, deprecated patterns, and current standards that guide the codebase's evolution and refactoring efforts.
3.  **Guide Documentation Strategy:** Define the principles and plans for managing project documentation, including the approach to historical preservation and learning from past audits.
4.  **Maintain High-Level Handoffs:** Store critical historical handoff documents that provide broad context on project status and AI collaboration.

## Remaining Documents and Their Purpose:

After the recent reorganization, the following documents remain in this directory:

*   **`00_Master_Plan.md`**: This is the core strategic blueprint for the entire AI-Native Engineering System. It outlines the vision, core architecture, and the major components of the system at a high level.
*   **`review-me-ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md`**: This document details key architectural transitions in the ScraperSky backend. It serves as a historical guide for understanding deprecated patterns and current standards, which is crucial for refactoring efforts.
*   **`review-me-doc_cleanup_plan.md`**: This document outlines the conservative plan for documentation cleanup. Its purpose is to ensure that historical documentation, including anti-patterns and audit findings, is preserved as invaluable learning material for the AI system.
*   **`review-me-AI_Handoff_20250531.md`**: This is a historical handoff document that provides crucial context on past AI interactions and the initial vector database setup. It has been updated with a post-script clarification to resolve previous ambiguities regarding the vector database's completion status.

This directory is designed to offer a clear, strategic overview of the project's direction and foundational principles, while detailed implementation guides for specific components are now located in `Docs/Docs_16_ScraperSky_Code_Canon/`.
