# ScraperSky - Audit and Mapping Roadmap

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:** This document tracks the status of architectural audits and refinements for the ScraperSky backend project. It outlines outstanding tasks related to verification, definition, and documentation, and specifies the process for creating detailed workflow maps. These maps will trace user interactions or system triggers through the backend codebase, explicitly verifying adherence to the established architectural principles documented in `/Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES`.

**Complements:**

- `0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md`: High-level mapping of UI/features to backend components.
- `0.2_ScraperSky_Architecture_and_Implementation_Status.md`: Summary of overall project status and component completion.

**Context:** The primary static page `/static/scraper-sky-mvp.html`, along with other supporting files in `/static`, currently serves as the integrated testing interface for the backend API. This entire environment (backend + static pages) must be verified before deployment and the development of a separate React frontend.

## 2. Completed Audits & Refinements (Summary)

Based on recent work orders and reviews (`project-docs/28` through `project-docs/31`), the following areas have undergone significant auditing, refactoring, and standardization:

- **ORM Enforcement:** Strict adherence to SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM patterns mandated and implemented; raw SQL eliminated. (Ref: `28.1`, `01-ABSOLUTE_ORM_REQUIREMENT.md`, `28.2`).
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Standardized exclusively on Supavisor with required parameters (`raw_sql`, `no_prepare`, `statement_cache_size=0`). (Ref: `28.1`, `07-DATABASE_CONNECTION_STANDARDS.md`, `20-DATABASE_CONNECTION_ASYNCPG_COMPATIBILITY.md`).
- **Authentication Simplification:** RBAC and Tenant Isolation features deliberately removed; replaced with basic JWT authentication. (Ref: `28.1`, `08-RBAC_SYSTEM_SIMPLIFIED.md`, `09-TENANT_ISOLATION_REMOVED.md`, `11-AUTHENTICATION_BOUNDARY.md`).
- **Background Task Architecture:** Standardized on APScheduler polling database status columns via shared scheduler instance. (Ref: `28.1`, `21-SCHEDULED_TASKS_APSCHEDULER_PATTERN.md`, `24-SHARED_SCHEDULER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`).
- **Job Tracking:** Dedicated `Job` model implemented for tracking background tasks like email scraping. (Ref: `29.1`, `29.4`).
- **Status Enum Standardization:** Audited and standardized status `Enum` definitions (Python, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic) and string values across the backend. (Ref: `31.1`, `27-ENUM_HANDLING_STANDARDS.md`).
- **JavaScript Modularity:** Initial refactoring of frontend JS for modularity and shared utilities (`google-maps-common.js`). (Ref: `30.1`).
- **Database Schema:** Introduced `jobs`, `contacts`, `pages` tables to support EmailHunter refactor. (Ref: `29.1`, `29.3`).
- **Concurrency Control:** Addressed potential race conditions in DB polling (e.g., using `skip_locked`). (Ref: `29.9`).
- **Code Quality:** Applied Ruff linting/formatting and resolved numerous issues (imports, types, async/await). (Ref: `28.2`).
- **API Standardization:** Efforts towards standardizing API request/response patterns. (Ref: `15-API_STANDARDIZATION_GUIDE.md`).
- **Transaction Management:** Established pattern of routers owning transaction boundaries. (Ref: `13-TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`).

## 3. Pending Audits, Definitions & Tasks

- **Workflow Documentation:**
  - [ ] Detailed Email Processing Workflow & Data Flow (API -> Job -> Task -> Scraper -> DB Models `jobs`, `contacts`, `pages`).
  - [ ] Detailed SiteHarvest Workflow (Define scope beyond basic metadata, map flow).
  - [ ] Detailed ContactLaunchpad Workflow (Define scope for export/integration, map flow).
- **Component Specification:**
  - [ ] FrontendScout: Define scope, features, and map to potential backend logic/UI.
- **Verification & Testing:**
  - [ ] End-to-end testing of all major workflows defined in `0.1` (especially status transitions triggering background jobs).
  - [ ] Performance testing/tuning of background schedulers and scraping tasks.
  - [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage (Ref: `22-TESTING_CONVENTIONS_GUIDE.md`, `06-COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_PLAN.md`).
- **Code & Architecture Audit:**
  - [ ] Naming Convention Audit: Review file, function, variable names against standards (define if needed).
  - [ ] Unused Code/File Audit: Identify and remove orphan files/code (outcome of mapping process).
  - [ ] Error Handling Consistency Review: Ensure standardized error handling across all APIs and services.
  - [ ] Logging Consistency Review: Verify consistent and useful logging.
- **Frontend:**
  - [ ] Verify functionality of all 6 reportedly working tabs in `/static` against backend APIs.
  - [ ] Implement any missing UI elements shown in screenshots (e.g., dedicated views for Domain Scanner, Social Media Staging, Contact Staging if not already present).
  - [ ] Final UI polish and testing for the static testing interface.

## 4. Feature Workflow Mapping Specification

- **Goal:** To create detailed ASCII flow diagrams for each core feature/workflow, mapping UI interactions (from `/static` pages) or system triggers through the backend codebase (`routers`, `services`, `tasks`, `models`). Each map must explicitly show where architectural principles (from `/Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/`) are applied and enforced.
- **Process:** Use the refined mapping in `0.1` (Service Name -> UI -> Backend) as the starting point for each feature.
- **Format:** One ASCII diagram per feature/workflow.
- **Content per Step:** Include full file path, function/method name, and a brief description of the action.
- **Principle Callouts:** Use bracketed tags within the flow diagram to reference specific principles and the file/line where they are applied. Examples:
  - `--> | Request Received | /src/routers/domains.py:list_domains [AUTH: JWT @ jwt_auth.py:get_current_user]`
  - `--> | Begin DB Operation | /src/routers/domains.py:list_domains [TRANSACTION: Router Owns]`
  - `--> | Fetch Data | /src/services/domain_service.py:get_domains [ORM: SQLAlchemy Select]`
  - `--> | Queue Background Task | /src/routers/email_scanner.py:scan_website_for_emails_api [SCHEDULING: Add Task]`
  - `--> | Poll for Jobs | /src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py:process_pending_jobs [SCHEDULING: Status Poll]`
  - `--> | Check Status | /src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py:process_pending_jobs [ENUM_STD: DeepScanStatusEnum.Queued]`
  - `--> | Execute Task | /src/tasks/email_scraper.py:scan_website_for_emails [ASYNC_TASK: Background Job]`
- **Target Features/Workflows (Initial List - Requires Refinement based on updated `0.1`):**
  - [ ] LocalMiner: Google Search (Single Search)
  - [ ] LocalMiner: Staging Curation -> Deep Scan Queueing
  - [ ] LocalMiner: Local Business Curation -> Domain Extraction Queueing
  - [ ] Domain Management: Domain Curation -> Metadata/Sitemap Queueing
  - [ ] ContentMap: Sitemap Curation -> Deep Scrape Queueing
  - [ ] EmailHunter: Scan Initiation & Processing
  - [ ] Batch Processing: Batch Search Initiation
  - [ ] Batch Processing: Batch Sitemap Initiation
  - [ ] Results Viewing (Results Viewer)
  - _Add maps for other services like FrontendScout, SiteHarvest, SocialRadar, ContactLaunchpad once defined._

## 5. Next Steps

1.  Refine `0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md` to accurately map Service Names to UI Tabs/Static Files and Backend Components.
2.  Update `0.2_ScraperSky_Architecture_and_Implementation_Status.md` incorporating insights from all reviews (`28`-`31`) and corrected frontend status.
3.  Begin creating the first detailed feature workflow map (e.g., LocalMiner Search) as specified in Section 4 above.
4.  Systematically address items listed in Section 3 (Pending Audits & Definitions).
