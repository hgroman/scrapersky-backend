**Parent Document**: v_1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md  
**Layer Focus**: Business Logic, Background Processing  
**Purpose**: Essential architectural principles for Layer 4 - Arbiter

## Layer 4: Services & Schedulers Overview

**Primary Responsibility**: Business logic and background processing  
**Key Patterns**: Service functions, APScheduler

## Core Standards

### Service Organization
- Dedicated service file for each workflow: `src/services/{workflow_name}_service.py`
- Function naming: `process_single_{source_table_name}_for_{workflow_name}`
- Services are transaction-aware but don't create transactions
- Services accept session parameters from routers

### Scheduler Organization
- Dedicated scheduler file for each workflow: `src/services/{workflow_name}_scheduler.py`
- Each scheduler registers with shared APScheduler instance
- Schedulers manage their own database sessions
- Standard job configuration via environment variables

### Reference Implementation
`src/services/page_curation_service.py` and `src/services/page_curation_scheduler.py`

## Core Architectural Principles

### Standardized Background Processing
- Single shared AsyncIOScheduler instance for all background tasks
- Status-driven task queuing (typically using "Queued" status)
- Consistent error handling and reporting
- Self-contained session management in background tasks

### Background Processing Configuration
- All background tasks use APScheduler
- Single shared scheduler instance in `src/scheduler_instance.py`
- Jobs triggered by status changes (usually to "Queued")
- Standard job configuration via environment variables

### Service Transaction Principles
- Services NEVER create their own transactions
- Services accept sessions as parameters
- Services are "transaction-aware" - they know they're running within a transaction
- Background schedulers create and manage their own sessions/transactions

## Workflow Implementation Pattern - Layer 4 Steps

4. **Service Implementation**
   - Create service in `src/services/{workflow_name}_service.py`
   - Implement `process_single_{source_table_name}_for_{workflow_name}` function
   - Accept session as parameter, never create transactions

5. **Scheduler Implementation**
   - Create scheduler in `src/services/{workflow_name}_scheduler.py`
   - Implement `process_{workflow_name}_queue` function
   - Add `setup_{workflow_name}_scheduler` function
   - Register scheduler in `main.py` lifespan context

## Standard Service Pattern

```python
async def process_single_item_for_workflow(
    session: AsyncSession,  # Received from router
    item_id: int,
    params: dict
) -> ProcessingResult:
    # Business logic here
    # No transaction management
    pass
```

## Standard Scheduler Pattern

```python
async def process_workflow_queue():
    async with get_async_session() as session:
        async with session.begin():  # Scheduler owns transaction
            # Process queued items
            pass
```

## Current Technical Debt

### Known Issues
- Some services creating their own sessions instead of receiving as parameters
- Non-standard function naming in older services
- Legacy task registration patterns
- Potential lingering inconsistencies in older services not yet fully standardized

### Compliance Status
- **Services: 65% Compliant** - Direct session creation, non-standard naming
- **Schedulers: 90% Compliant** - Legacy task registration patterns

## Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Session Management**: Services receive sessions, schedulers create sessions
2. **Status-Driven Processing**: All workflows triggered by status changes
3. **Error Recovery**: Consistent error status setting across all workflows
4. **Batch Processing**: Standard batch size configuration via environment variables

## Multi-Stage Data Processing Workflows

- Data flows through sequential enrichment stages
- Each stage has well-defined status tracking
- Background services monitor status changes to trigger processing
- Standardized error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Environment Variable Patterns

- Workflow settings pattern: `{WORKFLOW_NAME}_SCHEDULER_{PARAMETER}`
- Standard parameters: BATCH_SIZE, INTERVAL_SECONDS, MAX_INSTANCES
- All configuration centralized in settings.py
