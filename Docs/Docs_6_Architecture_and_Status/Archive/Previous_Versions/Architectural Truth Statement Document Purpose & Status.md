Architectural Evolution
The ScraperSky backend has evolved through distinct phases, with each phase addressing different architectural concerns:

1. Foundation Phase (Early Documents - 01-10)
This phase established the fundamental project infrastructure:

Database connection patterns and authorization frameworks
Basic testing approaches
Initial architectural patterns
Key Outcomes: Core database connectivity standards, initial service boundaries, baseline architectural concepts.

2. Service Standardization Phase (11-20)
This phase focused intensively on standardizing background services:

Background task scheduling mechanisms
Deep scraping service implementations
Cross-service data flows
Transaction management standardization
Service separation of concerns
Key Outcomes: Standardized service layer, clear transaction boundaries, improved separation of concerns between components.

3. Integration & Refinement Phase (21-30)
This phase integrated services with UI components and refined API interfaces:

UI tab standardization
Schema reorganization from api_models to dedicated schema files
Service interface refinements
JavaScript standardization and modularization
Key Outcomes: Improved frontend-backend integration, more modular UI components, better API contract management.

4. Quality & Consistency Phase (31-46)
This phase prioritized quality, consistency, and architectural enforcement:

Enum standardization across database and code
UI component consistency improvements
Codebase cleanup and technical debt reduction
Comprehensive background service audits
CI/CD enforcement mechanisms
Key Outcomes: Higher quality codebase, reduced technical debt, enforced architectural standards.

5. Advanced Workflows Phase (47-53)
The most recent phase has focused on comprehensive workflows and architectural formalization:

End-to-end workflow creation for various domain objects
System-wide architectural standardization
Layer-aware component organization
Technical debt elimination by layer
Key Outcomes: Formalized 7-layer architecture, standardized workflows, reduced cross-layer dependencies.

Core Architectural Principles
The following architectural principles now govern all development in the ScraperSky backend:

1. Strict Database Access Patterns
ORM-Only Rule: Raw SQL is strictly forbidden; all database interactions must use SQLAlchemy ORM
Standardized Connection Handling: Only FastAPI's dependency injection pattern is permitted for database connections
Transaction Responsibility Pattern:
Routers own transaction boundaries with explicit session.begin()
Services accept sessions but don't manage transactions
Background tasks manage their own sessions independently
2. Authentication Simplification
JWT authentication occurs ONLY at API gateway endpoints
Tenant isolation has been completely removed
Role-based access control (RBAC) has been simplified
Database operations NEVER handle JWT or tenant authentication
3. Standardized Background Processing
Single shared AsyncIOScheduler instance for all background tasks
Status-driven task queuing (typically using "Queued" status)
Consistent error handling and reporting
Self-contained session management in background tasks
4. Layered Architectural Awareness
Components have clear layer assignments
Cross-layer dependencies are explicit and minimized
Documentation and code organization reflect the 7-layer model
Each layer has defined responsibilities and boundaries
5. API Standardization
Uniform /api/v3/ versioning prefix for all endpoints
Consistent endpoint naming patterns
Standard response formats for success and error cases
Clean, well-defined API contracts via Pydantic models
6. UI Component Integration
Modular JavaScript organized in external files
Tab-based interface pattern
Standard UI-to-API communication patterns
Consistent visual and interaction design
7. Multi-Stage Data Processing Workflows
Data flows through sequential enrichment stages (Discovery → Triage → Business → Domain → Sitemap → Results)
Each stage has well-defined status tracking
Background services monitor status changes to trigger processing
Standardized error handling and recovery mechanisms
Key Technologies & Frameworks
FastAPI: Core web framework with dependency injection, request validation, and OpenAPI integration
SQLAlchemy 2.0: ORM framework for database access with type safety and async support
Pydantic: Data validation and settings management
Supabase: Database provider with connection pooling via Supavisor
APScheduler: Background task scheduling framework
asyncpg: Asynchronous PostgreSQL driver
Docker: Containerization for development and production environments
PostgreSQL: Primary database system

# ScraperSky Backend Architectural Truth Statement

**Date:** 2025-05-11
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active

## Purpose

This document serves as the primary architectural reference for the ScraperSky backend. As a living document, it:

- Provides a definitive reference for the 7-layer architecture
- Documents current implementation patterns across all layers
- Establishes clear naming conventions and standards
- Serves as the source of truth for architectural decisions
- Functions as the foundation for onboarding new developers
- Guides AI assistants when providing development support

## 1. 7-Layer Architecture Overview

The ScraperSky backend is organized into 7 distinct architectural layers, each with specific responsibilities and patterns. All components must be classified into exactly one of these layers:

| Layer # | Layer Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Patterns |
|---------|------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Layer 1 | Models & ENUMs | Data structure definition and persistence | SQLAlchemy models, Python Enums |
| Layer 2 | Schemas | Request/response validation and serialization | Pydantic models |
| Layer 3 | Routers | HTTP endpoint definition and transaction boundaries | FastAPI routers |
| Layer 4 | Services & Schedulers | Business logic and background processing | Service functions, APScheduler |
| Layer 5 | Configuration | System configuration and cross-cutting concerns | Settings, middleware |
| Layer 6 | UI Components | User interface elements | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Layer 7 | Testing | Verification of system functionality | Pytest fixtures and tests |

## 2. Current Implementation by Layer

### Layer 1: Models & ENUMs

#### Core Standards
- SQLAlchemy models defined in `src/models/{source_table_name}.py`
- Status enums follow `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}CurationStatus` and `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}ProcessingStatus` pattern
- Status enums inherit from `(str, Enum)` without the "Enum" suffix
- Standard enum values for curation: `New, Queued, Processing, Complete, Error, Skipped`
- Standard enum values for processing: `Queued, Processing, Complete, Error`

#### Reference Implementation
`src/models/page.py` with `PageCurationStatus` and `PageProcessingStatus`

#### Technical Debt
- `SitemapCurationStatusEnum` (uses "Enum" suffix)
- `SitemapImportCurationStatusEnum` (uses "Enum" suffix)
- Non-standard enum values ("Selected" vs "Queued")

### Layer 2: Schemas

#### Core Standards
- Workflow-specific schemas in `src/schemas/{workflow_name}.py`
- Generic entity schemas in `src/schemas/{source_table_name}.py`
- Request models use `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}...Request` naming
- Response models use `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}...Response` naming

#### Reference Implementation
`src/schemas/page_curation.py` with `PageCurationUpdateRequest`

#### Technical Debt
- `SitemapFileBatchUpdate` (missing "Request" suffix)

### Layer 3: Routers

#### Core Standards
- Routers defined in `src/routers/{workflow}_CRUD.py` when handling CRUD and curation
- All endpoints use `/api/v3/` prefix
- Routers own transaction boundaries using `async with session.begin()`
- Standard function naming: `update_{source_table_name}_status_batch`

#### Reference Implementation
`src/routers/google_maps_api.py` for transaction pattern

#### Technical Debt
- Some endpoints still using `/v1/` prefix (e.g., `/api/v1/sitemap-analyzer`)
- Inconsistent endpoint path patterns

### Layer 4: Services & Schedulers

#### Core Standards
- Dedicated scheduler file for each workflow: `src/services/{workflow_name}_scheduler.py`
- Dedicated service file for each workflow: `src/services/{workflow_name}_service.py`
- Function naming: `process_single_{source_table_name}_for_{workflow_name}`
- Each scheduler registers with shared APScheduler instance
- Schedulers are transaction-aware but don't create transactions

#### Reference Implementation
`src/services/page_curation_service.py` and `src/services/page_curation_scheduler.py`

#### Technical Debt
- Some services creating their own sessions instead of receiving as parameters
- Non-standard function naming

### Layer 5: Configuration

#### Core Standards
- Environment variables in UPPERCASE with underscores
- Workflow settings pattern: `{WORKFLOW_NAME}_SCHEDULER_{PARAMETER}`
- Settings accessed via `from ..config.settings import settings`
- JWT authentication happens ONLY at API gateway endpoints
- No tenant filtering in database operations

#### Reference Implementation
`src/config/settings.py`

#### Technical Debt
- Some remaining tenant isolation logic in database operations

### Layer 6: UI Components

#### Core Standards
- Tab `data-panel` attribute: `{workflowNameCamelCase}Panel`
- Panel `div` id: `{workflowNameCamelCase}Panel`
- JavaScript files: `{workflow-name-kebab-case}-tab.js`
- Status dropdown text uses actual enum values

#### Reference Implementation
`domain-curation-tab.js` and corresponding HTML in `scraper-sky-mvp.html`

#### Technical Debt
- Inline JavaScript in some HTML files
- Inconsistent element ID naming

### Layer 7: Testing

#### Core Standards
- Tests organized by component type in `tests/` directory
- Service tests in `tests/services/test_{workflow_name}_service.py`
- Scheduler tests in `tests/scheduler/test_{workflow_name}_scheduler.py`
- Workflow tests in `tests/workflows/test_{workflow_name}_workflow.py`

#### Reference Implementation
`tests/services/test_sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py`

## 3. Cross-Cutting Architectural Principles

### Transaction Management
- **Core principle:** "Routers own transaction boundaries, services are transaction-aware but do not create transactions"
- Routers use `async with session.begin()` to create transaction boundaries
- Services accept session parameters and never create transactions
- Background tasks create their own sessions and manage transactions

### JWT Authentication
- JWT authentication happens ONLY at API gateway endpoints
- Database operations NEVER handle JWT or tenant authentication
- No tenant isolation across the system

### Error Handling
- FastAPI's native error handling used throughout the application
- Custom ErrorService has been removed

### Background Processing
- All background tasks use APScheduler
- Single shared scheduler instance in `src/scheduler_instance.py`
- Jobs triggered by status changes (usually to "Queued")
- Standard job configuration via environment variables

## 4. Workflow Implementation Pattern

The standard workflow implementation pattern follows these steps:

1. **Model & Status Definition (Layer 1)**
   - Define SQLAlchemy model in `src/models/{source_table_name}.py`
   - Create status enums: `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}CurationStatus` and `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}ProcessingStatus`
   - Add status columns to model: `{workflow_name}_curation_status` and `{workflow_name}_processing_status`

2. **Schema Definition (Layer 2)**
   - Create request/response schemas in `src/schemas/{workflow_name}.py`
   - Define `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}UpdateRequest` and `{WorkflowNameTitleCase}UpdateResponse`

3. **Router Implementation (Layer 3)**
   - Create router in `src/routers/{workflow}_CRUD.py`
   - Implement status update endpoint with `async with session.begin()`
   - Handle dual-status update (curation → processing) logic

4. **Service Implementation (Layer 4)**
   - Create service in `src/services/{workflow_name}_service.py`
   - Implement `process_single_{source_table_name}_for_{workflow_name}` function

5. **Scheduler Implementation (Layer 4)**
   - Create scheduler in `src/services/{workflow_name}_scheduler.py`
   - Implement `process_{workflow_name}_queue` function
   - Add `setup_{workflow_name}_scheduler` function
   - Register scheduler in `main.py` lifespan context

6. **UI Implementation (Layer 6)**
   - Add tab and panel to HTML with proper IDs
   - Create `{workflow-name-kebab-case}-tab.js` file
   - Implement status filters and batch update functionality

7. **Testing (Layer 7)**
   - Create service tests
   - Create scheduler tests
   - Create end-to-end workflow tests

## 5. Implementation Status

| Component Type | Compliant % | Key Technical Debt |
|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| Models & ENUMs | 80% | Non-standard enum naming, inconsistent base classes |
| Schemas | 75% | Missing "Request"/"Response" suffixes, non-workflow file organization |
| Routers | 82% | Inconsistent transaction boundaries, API versioning issues |
| Services | 65% | Direct session creation, non-standard function naming |
| Schedulers | 90% | Legacy task registration patterns |
| UI Components | 70% | Inline JavaScript, inconsistent element IDs |
| Tests | 60% | Incomplete coverage of some workflows |
