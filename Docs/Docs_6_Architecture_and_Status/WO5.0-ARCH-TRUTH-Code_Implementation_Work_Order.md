**Date Created:** 2025-05-11
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active - Implementation Track
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** Henry Groman

## Purpose & Scope

This Work Order initiates the code implementation track of the Architectural Truth initiative, focusing on aligning the ScraperSky backend codebase with the architectural principles established in the documentation track. While the documentation track has successfully created a clear, unified reference, this track will implement those standards systematically across the codebase.

## Background & Context

The Architectural Truth Documentation initiative has successfully established:

1. A definitive architectural reference (1.0-ARCH-TRUTH)
2. An implementation strategy (2.0-ARCH-TRUTH)
3. Clear layer classification (3.0-ARCH-TRUTH)
4. A state of the nation assessment (4.0-ARCH-TRUTH)

The comprehensive workflow audit (`workflow-comparison-structured.yaml`) has mapped all 7 workflows across all 7 architectural layers, revealing patterns, inconsistencies, and implementation targets. Current compliance metrics show a disparity between Layer 3 (Routers) at 82% compliance and Layer 4 (Services) at only 11% compliance.

## Objectives

1. **Increase Transaction Boundary Compliance**:
   - Raise Layer 3 compliance from 82% to 95%+
   - Raise Layer 4 compliance from 11% to 95%+

2. **Complete Tenant Isolation Removal**:
   - Eliminate remaining tenant references from all layers

3. **Standardize API Versioning**:
   - Ensure all endpoints use the `/api/v3/` prefix
   - Update sitemap_analyzer.py and any other non-compliant endpoints

4. **Implement Background Service Standardization**:
   - Apply the Producer-Consumer pattern consistently
   - Ensure proper Session management in all background tasks

5. **Add Transaction-Aware Service Parameters**:
   - Retrofit all services to accept session parameters
   - Ensure services do not create their own transactions

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a layer-first, workflow-second approach:

### Phase 1: Cross-Cutting Concerns (Layer 5)

1. **API Versioning Standardization**:
   - Audit all router files for correct `/api/v3/` prefixes
   - Update non-compliant endpoints (starting with sitemap_analyzer.py)

2. **Tenant Isolation Removal**:
   - Complete the systematic removal of tenant references
   - Verify database operations function without tenant filters

### Phase 2: Transaction Architecture (Layer 3 & 4)

1. **Router Transaction Boundary Enforcement**:
   - Audit remaining 18% non-compliant routers
   - Implement `async with session.begin()` pattern

2. **Service Transaction Awareness**:
   - Retrofit all services to accept session parameters
   - Remove any transaction creation in service layer
   - Increase compliance from 11% to 95%+

### Phase 3: Background Processing (Layer 4)

1. **Scheduler Standardization**:
   - Audit all background tasks for session management
   - Implement consistent polling pattern for status="Queued"
   - Ensure schedulers properly manage their own transactions

### Phase 4: Model & Schema Alignment (Layer 1 & 2)

1. **Pydantic Schema Standardization**:
   - Complete schema refactoring from api_models to src/schemas
   - Ensure consistent naming and validation patterns

2. **Enum Type Standardization**:
   - Audit all enum implementations for consistency
   - Address any discrepancies with ENUM_HANDLING_STANDARDS

## Success Criteria

The implementation track will be considered successful when:

1. Transaction boundary compliance reaches 95%+ for both routers and services
2. Tenant isolation is completely removed from all components
3. All API endpoints use the standardized v3 prefix
4. Background services follow consistent patterns with proper session management
5. No service creates its own transactions

## Key References

1. **Workflow Audit**:
   - `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflow-comparison-structured.yaml`

2. **Critical Architectural Principles**:
   - "Routers own transaction boundaries, services are transaction-aware but do not create transactions"
   - "All database access must use services/core/db_service.py with standardized methods"
   - "JWT authentication happens ONLY at API gateway endpoints"
   - "Database operations NEVER handle JWT or tenant authentication"

3. **Reference Implementation Examples**:
   - Router with proper transaction management: `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`
   - Service with proper session parameters: `src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py`

## Next Steps

1. Begin with API versioning standardization and tenant isolation removal (Phase 1)
2. Prioritize service transaction awareness to address the 11% compliance (Phase 2)
3. Implement consistent background processing patterns (Phase 3)
4. Complete schema and enum standardization (Phase 4)
