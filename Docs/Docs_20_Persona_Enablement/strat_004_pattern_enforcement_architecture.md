TITLE: STRAT\_004\_PATTERN\_ENFORCEMENT\_ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Toolchain & Persona Integration Blueprint for Pattern Recognition STATUS: DRAFT 001

---

## üéØ Purpose & Ecosystem Role

This document defines how ScraperSky personas integrate with tools to identify, enforce, and correct patterns and anti-patterns within the codebase and documentation.

This is Document 4 of 4 in the strategic foundation:

- Builds upon: `STRAT_001_PERSONA_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`, `STRAT_002_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLEMENT_PLAN.md`
- Used by: `STRAT_003_PERSONA_BOOT_PROCEDURE_TEMPLATE.md`, all `*-persona.md` definitions

---

## üß± Pattern Enforcement Architecture Overview

### üóÇÔ∏è Source Types

- **Code** (Python, SQL, Dockerfiles, configs)
- **Documentation** (Markdown, YAML, architectural manifests)
- **Knowledge Vector DB** (semantically embedded artifacts)

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Categories

#### A. Semantic Matching Tools

- `semantic_query_cli.py`: vector search via pgvector in Supabase
- `supabase-py vecs` (future): cleaner Pythonic vector DB client
- Embedding source: OpenAI (`text-embedding-3-small`, `code-search-babbage`, etc.)

#### B. Static Analysis Tools (Structure Matching)

- `Ruff`: for Python conventions and linting enforcement
- `Semgrep`: for AST-level pattern detection
- `mcp4_execute_sql`: for structured SQL pattern scans

#### C. Validation Oracles (Rule Definitions)

- `v_CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE-*.md`: defines standards & anti-patterns
- `WF*-LayerX_Audit_Report.md`: field reports documenting pattern violations

#### D. Runtime Execution Tools

- `FastAPI` endpoints that allow interactive persona querying
- Git hooks, DART journal syncs, CI integrations

## üîÅ Workflow Modes

### 1. **Proactive Audit Mode**

Used for bootstrapping or full-scope layer reviews:

- Persona loads all vector + convention material
- Runs Semgrep/Ruff against `src/` scoped to its layer
- Logs violations with link to associated rules

### 2. **Reactive Issue Mode**

Triggered by a specific ticket, bug, or anomaly:

- Persona queries vector DB for relevant context
- Validates live code snapshot using structural tools
- Provides targeted remediation steps or commit patch

### 3. **Sentinel Mode (Continuous)**

For live monitoring:

- Not active in MVP, but architected for future CI integration

---

## üß© Tool-Persona Interface Contract

Each persona must:

- Know what tool applies to its domain
- Know how to run it, or delegate to a system call
- Know where rules live and how to match output to them

Example Mapping:

```yaml
layer: services
persona: services_layer_persona
pattern_sources:
  - conventions: Docs/CONSOLIDATION_WORKSPACE/Layer4_Services/v_Layer-4.1-Services_Blueprint.md
  - audits: [WF1-*.md, WF2-*.md]
tools:
  semantic_vector:
    cli: semantic_query_cli.py
    filter: {"layer": "services"}
  static:
    semgrep: semgrep --config ./layer4_rules.yml
    ruff: ruff check src/services
```

---

## üì¶ Future Enhancements

- Wrap Semgrep output to auto-tag findings with vector DB metadata
- Unified report generator for pattern compliance
- Persona-specific `.yml` rule bundles for boot config

---

## üîó Related Strategic Artifacts

- `STRAT_001`: Persona governance
- `STRAT_002`: Knowledge filtering/indexing
- `STRAT_003`: Persona lifecycle boot procedure

This document defines how tooling and knowledge converge into **enforceable, interpretable, and persona-operable workflows** across the ScraperSky platform.
