# TRANSACTION VERIFICATION WORK ORDER: ScraperSky Backend

## 1. CONTEXT & BACKGROUND

### 1.1 Transaction Management Evolution

The ScraperSky backend has undergone significant improvements in database transaction management to address critical issues that were causing system instability. These improvements established a clear pattern for transaction handling across the application. However, we need to verify that this pattern has been consistently applied across all endpoints and background processes.

The core principle of our transaction management strategy is:

> **"Routers own transaction boundaries, services are transaction-aware but do not create transactions."**

This principle establishes clear separation of concerns and prevents the most common transaction errors encountered in our codebase, including:
- Nested transaction errors ("A transaction is already begun on this Session")
- Closed transaction errors ("Can't operate on closed transaction inside context manager")
- Transaction leakage in background tasks
- Improper error handling and recovery

### 1.2 Previous Implementation Efforts

Several key documents in the Docs3-_ContentMap folder detail the transaction management improvements:

1. **[16-TRANSACTION-MANAGEMENT-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md](16-TRANSACTION-MANAGEMENT-COMPREHENSIVE-GUIDE.md)** - Establishes the authoritative standard for database transactions
2. **[17-SITEMAP-TRANSACTION-FIX-WORK-ORDER.md](17-SITEMAP-TRANSACTION-FIX-WORK-ORDER.md)** - Details specific implementation steps for the ContentMap service
3. **[18-TRANSACTION-MANAGEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md](18-TRANSACTION-MANAGEMENT-IMPLEMENTATION-REPORT.md)** - Documents the successful implementation in the ContentMap service

Additionally, the AI_GUIDES folder contains critical information about database connection standards:

1. **[07-DATABASE_CONNECTION_STANDARDS.md](../AI_GUIDES/07-DATABASE_CONNECTION_STANDARDS.md)** - Details connection standards and Supavisor requirements

### 1.3 Current State

While the transaction management pattern has been successfully implemented in some services (notably the ContentMap service), we need to verify that all endpoints and background processes follow the established pattern. This verification is critical to ensure system stability and prevent database-related errors.

## 2. VERIFICATION SCOPE & OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Primary Objective

Conduct a comprehensive verification of all API endpoints, background tasks, and database operations to ensure they follow the established transaction management pattern.

### 2.2 Verification Scope

1. **All API Endpoints**: Every FastAPI router and endpoint in the application
2. **All Background Tasks**: Every background task that interacts with the database
3. **All Service Methods**: Every service method that performs database operations
4. **All Database Models**: Helper methods on database models that interact with the session

### 2.3 Success Criteria

The verification is successful when:

1. All API endpoints follow the established transaction management pattern
2. All background tasks create and manage their own sessions
3. All service methods are transaction-aware but do not create transactions
4. All database operations are performed within proper transaction boundaries
5. Error handling is properly implemented for transaction rollback
6. No nested transactions or transaction boundary violations are found

## 3. VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Standard Transaction Patterns

#### 3.1.1 Router Pattern (REQUIRED)

```python
@router.post("/endpoint")
async def create_entity(
    request: EntityCreateRequest,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db_session)
):
    # Router is responsible for transaction boundary
    async with session.begin():
        # Pass session to service
        entity = await entity_service.create_entity(
            session=session,
            data=request.dict()
        )

    # Return response after transaction is committed
    return EntityResponse.model_validate(entity)
```

#### 3.1.2 Service Pattern (REQUIRED)

```python
async def create_entity(self, session: AsyncSession, data: dict) -> Entity:
    # Check transaction state (for logging/debugging)
    in_transaction = session.in_transaction()
    logger.debug(f"Transaction state in create_entity: {in_transaction}")

    try:
        # Use session directly without managing transactions
        entity = Entity(**data)
        session.add(entity)

        # Flush to get generated values but don't commit
        await session.flush()

        return entity
    except Exception as e:
        # Log error but don't handle transaction - let it propagate
        logger.error(f"Error creating entity: {str(e)}")
        raise  # Must raise for proper transaction handling
```

#### 3.1.3 Background Task Pattern (REQUIRED)

```python
async def process_background_task(job_id: str, data: dict):
    # Import session factory
    from src.db.session import get_session

    # Create a new dedicated session for the background task
    async with get_session() as bg_session:
        try:
            # Explicitly manage transaction
            async with bg_session.begin():
                logger.info(f"Starting background processing for job: {job_id}")

                # Process data within transaction
                result = await service.process_data(
                    session=bg_session,
                    job_id=job_id,
                    data=data
                )

                logger.info(f"Background processing completed for job: {job_id}")
                return result
        except Exception as e:
            # Log errors but don't propagate since this is a background task
            logger.error(f"Error in background task {job_id}: {str(e)}")

            # Error recovery with separate session if needed
            try:
                async with get_session() as error_session:
                    async with error_session.begin():
                        # Update job status to failed
                        await job_service.update_job_status(
                            session=error_session,
                            job_id=job_id,
                            status="failed",
                            error_message=str(e)
                        )
            except Exception as inner_e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to update job status: {str(inner_e)}")
```

### 3.2 Verification Steps

- **Service-Created Transactions**: Services creating their own transactions instead of using the provided session

### 5.2 Session Management Issues

- **Session Leakage**: Sessions not properly closed after use
- **Multiple Session Creation**: Creating multiple sessions within the same execution path
- **Background Task Session Issues**: Background tasks not creating their own sessions

### 5.3 Error Handling Issues

- **Swallowed Exceptions**: Exceptions caught and not re-raised, preventing transaction rollback
- **Missing Error Recovery**: Background tasks without error recovery mechanisms
- **Improper Error Logging**: Insufficient error logging for debugging transaction issues

### 5.4 Anti-Patterns to Identify

- **Direct Commits in Services**: Services calling `await session.commit()`
- **Transaction Management in Services**: Services managing transactions with `async with session.begin()`
- **Session Creation in Services**: Services creating their own sessions instead of using the provided session
- **Nested Service Calls**: Services calling other services and passing the same session
