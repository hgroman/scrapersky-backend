You're absolutely right, and I apologize for not using the C.R.A.F.T. framework you shared. Let me create the work order properly following that template:

# RBAC Removal Completion Work Order

## Context

The ScraperSky backend modernization project has made significant progress in removing the complex Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. Initial efforts have successfully removed core RBAC files, updated router registrations, and modified many router files to use JWT-only authentication. Docker now starts successfully with these changes, and the health check endpoint responds correctly. However, a comprehensive audit is needed to ensure all RBAC components have been completely removed from the codebase. The current documentation indicates we're approximately 70% through the removal process, with several files and components still needing review and modification.

## Role

You are an expert Python backend developer specializing in FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and authentication systems with more than a decade of experience in removing legacy code and simplifying authentication mechanisms. You have successfully led numerous codebase modernization projects, particularly focusing on streamlining authentication systems without introducing regression bugs. You have deep knowledge of JWT authentication implementation and understand how to properly remove complex permission systems without breaking core functionality.

## Action

1. First, perform a complete systematic review of the entire codebase to identify any remaining RBAC components or references.
2. Methodically examine all router files for RBAC imports, function calls, and dependencies.
3. Review the main application file for any missed RBAC registrations or references.
4. Check all service files to identify and remove any RBAC service dependencies or implementations.
5. Inspect authentication and middleware components to ensure they're working without RBAC.
6. Examine utility files for any remaining RBAC helper functions or constants.
7. Review database models for RBAC-related models and references.
8. For each file containing RBAC references, completely remove them without creating dummy files or stubs, while maintaining JWT authentication.
9. Ensure consistent JWT authentication patterns are applied across all endpoints.
10. Update any tests that were relying on RBAC structures to work with JWT-only authentication.
11. Take a deep breath and ensure all changes maintain the integrity of the application.
12. If you have questions about specific files or components, please ask.

## Format

Provide your response in a clear, organized format:

1. Start with an executive summary of the RBAC removal completion process.
2. Create a detailed inventory table showing:
   - File path
   - RBAC components identified
   - Changes made
   - Status (Complete/Pending)
3. Include code snippets showing before/after changes for key files.
4. Organize findings by component category (Routers, Services, Models, Utilities).
5. Create a testing checklist for verifying the removal was successful.
6. Include a "Remaining Issues" section if any components couldn't be fully resolved.
7. End with a "Next Steps" section prioritizing any outstanding tasks.

## Target Audience

Your work order is intended for a senior backend developer who understands Python, FastAPI, and authentication systems well but needs specific guidance on completing the RBAC removal process. They prefer a systematic, thorough approach with clear documentation of all changes. They want to ensure no RBAC components remain in the codebase while maintaining proper JWT authentication throughout the application. They value completeness and correctness over speed.
