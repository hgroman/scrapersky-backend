# RBAC Removal Implementation Log

**Date: March 23, 2025**

This document chronicles the implementation process of removing the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system from the ScraperSky backend while preserving JWT authentication, as outlined in the RBAC Removal Work Order.

## Implementation Log

### 1. Initial Assessment

After examining the codebase, we identified several components of the RBAC system that needed to be removed or modified:

- RBAC router files: `rbac_core.py`, `rbac_permissions.py`, `rbac_features.py`
- RBAC utility files: `permissions.py` in the utils directory
- RBAC constants: `rbac.py` in the constants directory
- RBAC service files: Various files in the services/rbac directory
- RBAC model: `rbac.py` in the models directory

We also identified files that needed to be modified to remove RBAC dependencies:
- `src/routers/__init__.py`: To remove RBAC router imports
- `src/main.py`: To remove RBAC router registration
- `src/models/__init__.py`: To remove RBAC model imports
- `src/services/__init__.py`: To remove RBAC service imports
- Various router files that use RBAC permission checks

### 2. File Backup and Removal

Many RBAC files were already moved to a backup directory (`removed_rbac`). We backed up the remaining files:
- `src/models/rbac.py` â†’ `removed_rbac/models/rbac.py`

### 3. Modification of Core Files

#### 3.1 Router Package (`src/routers/__init__.py`)

Modified to:
- Comment out imports for RBAC-related routers
- Remove RBAC router exports from `__all__` list
- Add documentation note about RBAC removal

#### 3.2 Main Application (`src/main.py`)

Modified to:
- Comment out RBAC router imports
- Comment out RBAC router registration
- Add a log statement indicating RBAC routers have been removed
- Remove the RBAC management view endpoint

#### 3.3 Model Package (`src/models/__init__.py`)

Modified to:
- Comment out imports for RBAC-related models
- Comment out RBAC model exports from `__all__` list

#### 3.4 Service Package (`src/services/__init__.py`)

Modified to:
- Comment out imports for RBAC services
- Remove RBAC service instance creation
- Comment out RBAC service exports from `__all__` list

### 4. Testing and Error Resolution

After making the initial changes, we started Docker to test and encountered the following errors:

#### 4.1 First Error: Missing RBAC Service Module

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.services.rbac'
```

This error was resolved by modifying `src/services/__init__.py` to properly comment out RBAC service imports.

#### 4.2 Second Error: Missing Permissions Module

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.utils.permissions'
```

This error occurs in the `dev_tools.py` file that's trying to import from the removed permissions module.

### 5. Development Tools Router Modification Plan

The `dev_tools.py` file needs to be modified to:
1. Remove imports from `..utils.permissions` and `..constants.rbac`
2. Implement dummy functions to replace RBAC checks:
   - `require_permission` - Always returns True
   - `require_feature_enabled` - Always returns True
   - `require_role_level` - Always returns True
3. Define a dummy `ROLE_HIERARCHY` constant to maintain compatibility

### 6. Next Steps

1. Fix `dev_tools.py` to remove RBAC dependencies
2. Check other router files that may have similar dependencies:
   - `google_maps_api.py`
   - `batch_page_scraper.py`
   - `modernized_page_scraper.py`
3. After all errors are resolved, test the ContentMap feature to ensure it works properly
4. Document any remaining issues and their resolutions

## Implementation Summary

The RBAC removal process is underway but facing expected challenges with file dependencies. We've successfully modified core application files but still need to address dependencies in individual router files. The goal is to maintain functionality while removing the complex RBAC system in favor of simpler JWT authentication.

## Observations

1. The RBAC system in ScraperSky is deeply integrated across multiple components
2. Router files are most affected as they directly implement permission checks
3. The architecture uses both direct RBAC checks and dependency injection for authorization
4. Creating dummy functions to replace RBAC checks is the most efficient approach to maintain compatibility
