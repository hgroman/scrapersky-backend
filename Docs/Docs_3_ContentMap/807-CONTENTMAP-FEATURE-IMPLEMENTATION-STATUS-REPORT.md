# ContentMap Feature Implementation - Status Report

## 1. Original Issue

The ContentMap (Sitemap Analyzer) feature was broken with users receiving a 404 error when trying to use it:

```
Error: Status check failed with code 404 - Job not found. The job ID may be invalid or the job may have been removed.
```

## 2. Diagnostics Performed

```bash
grep -n "compat_router" src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py.bak || echo "No backup file found"
```

### 2.1 API Endpoint Testing

- Tested `/api/v3/sitemap/scan` endpoint - Received 403 "Feature not enabled: contentmap"
- Tested status endpoints - Both v1 and v3 paths were attempted by frontend
- Tested Docker configuration and environment variables
- Checked database feature flags for "contentmap" feature

### 2.2 Code Analysis

- Discovered compatibility code for legacy v1 API endpoints that were no longer working
- Found missing feature flag activation in the database for "contentmap" feature
- Identified transaction-related issues in the backend code
- Found empty implementation of sitemap processing logic with placeholder TODOs

## 3. Changes Made

### 3.1 Removed Legacy v1 API Code

We eliminated redundant and non-functional v1 API compatibility code:

- In `modernized_sitemap.py`:

  - Removed the compatibility router and all legacy endpoints
  - Updated the status URL to use v3 instead of v1

  ```python
  # Before
  return SitemapScrapingResponse(job_id=result.job_id, status_url=result.status_url)
  # After
  return SitemapScrapingResponse(job_id=result.job_id, status_url=f"/api/v3/sitemap/status/{result.job_id}")
  ```

- In `src/routers/__init__.py`:

  - Updated import statement to remove compat_router

  ```python
  # Before
  from .modernized_sitemap import router as modernized_sitemap_router, compat_router as sitemap_compat_router
  # After
  from .modernized_sitemap import router as modernized_sitemap_router
  ```

- In `contentmap.html`:
  - Removed v1 endpoint from fallback polling logic
  ```javascript
  // Before
  urlsToTry.push(`/api/v3/sitemap/status/${jobId}`);
  urlsToTry.push(`/api/v1/status/${jobId}`);
  // After
  urlsToTry.push(`/api/v3/sitemap/status/${jobId}`);
  ```

### 3.2 Enabled ContentMap Feature

- Used SQL query to enable the feature for the tenant:

```sql
INSERT INTO tenant_features (tenant_id, feature_id, is_enabled)
VALUES ('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', '2a2f67fd-3ebb-4645-8d48-bf2b5bc7d6c3', true)
ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, feature_id) DO UPDATE SET is_enabled = true;
```

## 4. Current Status

The application is now in a partially working state:

- The "contentmap" feature is correctly enabled in the database
- The frontend is now able to submit requests successfully
- Backend properly accepts requests and generates job IDs
- Status checks work correctly via the v3 API endpoint

However, there's a critical issue:

- **The actual sitemap processing logic is not implemented**
- Jobs remain in "running" state indefinitely
- No results are ever returned to the user

## 5. Missing Implementation Details

The actual sitemap processing logic is missing in `src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py`:

```python
# _process_domain method contains placeholders instead of implementation:
# TODO: Implement the actual domain processing logic here
# This will include:
# 1. Standardize domain
# 2. Extract metadata
# 3. Store results in database
# 4. Update job status
```

Similarly, the job status tracking is mocked:

```python
# get_job_status always returns "running" status:
return JobStatusResponse(
    status="running",
    job_id=job_id,
    message="Job is currently running",
    metadata=None
)
```

## 6. Database Issues

- There are two feature flags related to sitemap functionality:
  - `contentmap` (ID: 2a2f67fd-3ebb-4645-8d48-bf2b5bc7d6c3)
  - `deep-analysis` (ID: f65d99f6-79a9-49e7-9dc5-a4111eaaddd0)
- Both were disabled by default but are now enabled
- There are RBAC errors with dev-admin-id not being a valid UUID

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Implement the core sitemap processing logic** in `_process_domain` method:

   - Add actual sitemap discovery code
   - Implement URL extraction logic
   - Store results in the database

2. **Fix job status tracking**:

   - Implement proper database schema for job status
   - Update job status throughout processing
   - Return actual status instead of hardcoded "running"

3. **Handle database transaction issues**:
   - Fix the session management in background tasks
   - Ensure proper transaction handling for background jobs

### 7.2 Secondary Improvements

1. Improve error handling in the frontend to show meaningful messages to users
2. Add timeouts for stuck jobs
3. Implement pagination for large sitemaps
4. Add progress tracking for better user experience

## 8. Testing Instructions

To continue development:

1. Start the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" -H "X-Tenant-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"base_url": "https://example.com", "tenant_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", "max_pages": 10000}' http://localhost:8000/api/v3/sitemap/scan
```

3. Check the job status:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" -H "X-Tenant-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000" http://localhost:8000/api/v3/sitemap/status/{job_id}
```

4. Monitor logs for detailed errors:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow
```

This report outlines the work done, current status, and next steps for completing the ContentMap feature implementation.
