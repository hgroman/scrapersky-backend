# RBAC Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to remove the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system from the ScraperSky backend while maintaining basic JWT authentication. The goal was to simplify the authentication system to resolve issues with the ContentMap feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. Files Backed Up

The following RBAC-related files were backed up to the `removed_rbac` directory:

- `src/models/rbac.py` → `removed_rbac/models/rbac.py`
- `src/constants/rbac.py` → `removed_rbac/rbac.py`
- `src/utils/permissions.py` → `removed_rbac/permissions.py`

### 2. Routers Package Modifications

In `src/routers/__init__.py`:
- Commented out imports for RBAC-related routers
- Removed RBAC router exports from `__all__` list
- Added documentation note about RBAC removal

### 3. Main Application Modifications

In `src/main.py`:
- Commented out RBAC router imports
- Commented out RBAC router registration
- Added a log statement indicating RBAC routers have been removed
- Removed the RBAC management view endpoint

### 4. Model Package Modifications

In `src/models/__init__.py`:
- Commented out imports for RBAC-related models
- Commented out RBAC model exports from `__all__` list

### 5. Router Files Modifications

The following router files were modified to remove RBAC checks while maintaining JWT validation:

- `src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py`
- `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`
- `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`
- `src/routers/modernized_page_scraper.py`

In each file:
- Commented out RBAC-related imports
- Commented out permission check functions (`require_permission`)
- Commented out feature flag checks (`require_feature_enabled`)
- Commented out role level checks (`require_role_level`)
- Added logging statements for JWT-only validation

## Preserved Authentication

The following JWT authentication components were preserved:

- `src/auth/jwt_auth.py` - JWT token generation and validation
- `src/auth/dependencies.py` - Authentication dependencies
- Development mode JWT bypass for testing

## Expected Behavior

After these changes:

1. The application should start without RBAC-related errors
2. Endpoints should validate JWT tokens but skip RBAC permission checks
3. The ContentMap feature should work without RBAC-related issues
4. All API endpoints in routers should remain functional using only JWT auth
5. The RBAC management UI will not be accessible

## Next Steps

1. Start Docker containers to test the application
2. Monitor logs for any errors related to RBAC removal
3. Test all API endpoints with a valid JWT token
4. Test the ContentMap feature to verify it now works without RBAC checks
5. Address any issues that arise due to RBAC removal

## Notes

- Database tables related to RBAC (roles, permissions, etc.) have not been removed
- Model definitions for RBAC tables still exist but are not imported
- A future phase could include removing RBAC database tables if they aren't needed

## Conclusion

The RBAC system has been successfully removed from the application, leaving only the JWT authentication mechanism in place. This should simplify the authentication flow and resolve issues with the ContentMap feature.
