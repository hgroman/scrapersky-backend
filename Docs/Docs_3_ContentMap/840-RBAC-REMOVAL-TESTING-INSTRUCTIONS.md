# ScraperSky RBAC Removal: Testing Instructions and Status Summary

## Prompt for Testing Team

You are tasked with testing the ScraperSky backend after the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system has been removed. The development team has made code changes to simplify the authentication system by removing RBAC components while preserving JWT authentication and tenant isolation.

Before you begin testing, please understand the following context:

### What Has Been Accomplished

1. **Code Removal**: The team has removed or commented out RBAC-specific code from:
   - JWT authentication modules (`src/auth/jwt_auth.py`, `src/auth/dependencies.py`)
   - Router files in `src/routers/` directory
   - Service initialization (`src/services/__init__.py`)
   - RBAC services and imports throughout the codebase

2. **Compatibility Layer**: Simple compatibility functions have been added where necessary to ensure existing code continues to work without RBAC:
   - JWT authentication still works but without permission checking
   - Tenant isolation is preserved to maintain multi-tenancy
   - Basic admin role checking is preserved through JWT claims

3. **Documentation**: The changes have been documented in:
   - `Docs3-_ContentMap/34-RBAC-Removal-Implementation-Results.md`
   - Code comments explaining where RBAC components were removed

### What Needs Testing

The development team completed the code removal phase but was unable to complete functional testing. Your task is to verify that the application works correctly with the simplified JWT-only authentication by testing:

1. **Application Startup**:
   - Does the application start without errors?
   - Are there any error logs related to missing RBAC components?
   - Do all routes register correctly?

2. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Does the system correctly validate JWT tokens?
   - Are invalid tokens properly rejected?
   - Does the development token (`scraper_sky_2024`) work in dev environment?
   - Do authenticated endpoints reject requests without valid tokens?

3. **Tenant Isolation**:
   - Can users only access resources within their tenant?
   - Are cross-tenant access attempts properly blocked?
   - Do admin users have appropriate access across tenants?

4. **API Functionality**:
   - Test each major endpoint to ensure it works without RBAC
   - Key endpoints to test:
     - `/api/v3/google_maps_api/search` and `/api/v3/google_maps_api/status`
     - `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/process`
     - `/api/v3/sitemap/analyze`
     - `/api/v3/profiles` endpoints

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Are authentication errors properly handled?
   - Are tenant isolation errors properly handled?
   - Do endpoints return appropriate error responses?

### Testing Resources

The following resources are available for testing:

1. **Test Scripts**: Located in `scripts/tests/` directory:
   - `test_authentication.py`: Tests JWT authentication
   - `test_google_maps_api.py`: Tests Google Maps API endpoints
   - Other test scripts for specific components

2. **Testing Environment**: Use the Docker container for testing:
   - Development token: `scraper_sky_2024`
   - Default tenant ID: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

3. **Documentation**: Review these documents for additional context:
   - `Docs3-_ContentMap/33-RBAC-Removal-Implementation-Plan.md`: Original plan
   - `Docs3-_ContentMap/34-RBAC-Removal-Implementation-Results.md`: Implementation results
   - `Docs3-_ContentMap/38-RBAC-Removal-Continuation-Guide.md`: Overview

### Reporting Format

```

### Important Notes

1. **Focus on Functionality**: The goal is to verify that the application functions correctly without RBAC, not to add new features or make improvements.

2. **Document All Issues**: Document any issues encountered during testing, even if they seem minor.

3. **Be Thorough**: Test all critical endpoints and authentication scenarios.

4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Test with invalid tokens, missing tokens, cross-tenant access attempts, etc.

5. **Check for Regression**: Ensure that the application behaves as expected and that no functionality has been lost due to RBAC removal.

Please proceed with testing and document your results. This testing phase is critical to ensure the successful completion of the RBAC removal project.

## Technical Context for Testers

### Authentication Flow Without RBAC

1. User provides JWT token in Authorization header
2. Token is validated using JWT validation (signature, expiration)
3. User information is extracted from token claims
4. Basic role information (admin vs. non-admin) is extracted from token
5. Tenant ID is extracted from token or header
6. Tenant isolation is enforced (users can only access their tenant's data)

### Key Files to Examine for Testing

1. `src/auth/jwt_auth.py`: Core JWT authentication
2. `src/auth/dependencies.py`: FastAPI dependency functions for auth
3. `src/auth/tenant_isolation.py`: Tenant isolation enforcement
4. `src/services/core/auth_service.py`: Simplified authentication service

### Expected JWT Token Claims

A valid JWT token should contain:
- `sub`: User ID
- `tenant_id`: Tenant ID
- `roles`: Array of role names (e.g., ["admin"])
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp

### Current Status: 70% Complete

The RBAC removal is approximately 70% complete, with code removal phases completed but testing phases incomplete. Your testing will help verify that the remaining 30% can be completed successfully.
