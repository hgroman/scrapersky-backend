# RBAC Removal Continuation Guide

## Context & Background

The ScraperSky backend is undergoing modernization to simplify its authentication system by removing the complex Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system while preserving JWT authentication and tenant isolation. The RBAC removal is approximately 70% complete (Steps 1-4), with Steps 5-14 remaining.

### Current Status

- RBAC router imports and registrations have been removed from main.py
- RBAC router files have been moved to the removed_rbac directory
- RBAC-related imports have been commented out in various key files
- The JWT authentication module has been updated to remove RBAC dependencies
- Model definitions are being preserved for future reference

## Essential Documentation

Before proceeding, review these key documents to understand the full context:

1. **Implementation Plan**: `/Docs3-_ContentMap/33-RBAC-Removal-Implementation-Plan.md`
   - Contains the 5-phase, 14-step plan for RBAC removal
   - Details specific files to modify and expected changes

2. **Implementation Progress**: `/Docs3-_ContentMap/34-RBAC-Removal-Implementation-Results.md`
   - Tracks progress through the steps
   - Documents what has been changed so far (Steps 1-4)

3. **Model Relationships**: `/Docs3-_ContentMap/RBAC-Model-Relationships-Documentation.md`
   - Documents how RBAC models relate to each other
   - Important for understanding what to preserve vs. remove

4. **Context Guide**: `/Docs3-_ContentMap/35-RBAC-Removal-Context-Guide.md`
   - Provides overall architectural context
   - Lists key files and components affected by RBAC removal

## Task Summary

Continue the RBAC removal process by implementing Steps 5-14 from the plan. The focus is strictly on REMOVING RBAC components - not implementing new functionality or replacement systems.

## Critical Guidelines

1. **REMOVAL ONLY** - Your task is exclusively to REMOVE RBAC components. Do NOT add new functionality, fields, methods, or systems.

2. **FOLLOW THE PLAN EXACTLY** - The implementation plan is documented and should be followed step by step without deviation.

3. **NO CREATIVE SOLUTIONS** - Do not attempt to "replace" or "improve" anything. If removing code breaks functionality, document it clearly but do not create alternative implementations.

4. **DOCUMENT REMOVALS ONLY** - In the progress file, document ONLY what you removed, not what you added.

5. **MINIMUM NECESSARY CHANGES** - Make the absolute minimum changes required for the application to run without RBAC code.

6. **PRESERVE MODEL DEFINITIONS** - Keep RBAC model files for future reference, but ensure they're not actively used.

7. **BEGIN AT STEP #5** - Continue from Step #5: Update Dependencies, which has not been started yet.

## Key Files & Components

### Auth Components
- `/src/auth/jwt_auth.py` - JWT authentication (already updated)
- `/src/auth/auth_service.py` - Authentication service (already simplified)
- `/src/auth/dependencies.py` - Authentication dependencies

### Service Components
- `/src/services/__init__.py` - Service initialization with RBAC imports commented out
- `/src/services/core/auth_service.py` - Core auth service implementation

### Model Components
- `/src/models/__init__.py` - Model initialization with RBAC imports commented out
- `/src/models/rbac.py` - RBAC models to preserve but not use
- `/removed_rbac/` - Directory containing removed RBAC components

### Router Components
- Various router files that may still contain RBAC permission checks

## Specific Implementation Steps

### Phase 2: Clean Up Auth Components (Step #5)
- Update dependencies.py to work without RBAC
- Remove any remaining RBAC service references
- Ensure JWT auth works independently

### Phase 3: Clean Up Service Layer (Steps #6-7)
- Update services/__init__.py (although it appears most RBAC imports are already commented out)
- Find and remove RBAC service calls in other services

### Phase 4: Clean Up Router Components (Steps #8-10)
- Inventory all routers with RBAC references
- Standardize JWT-only authentication
- Test that routers function without RBAC

### Phase 5: Testing (Steps #11-14)
- Verify application starts without errors
- Test that JWT authentication still works
- Test tenant isolation
- Test all major endpoints

## Documentation Format

When completing each step, document using this format in the implementation results file:

```markdown
#### [Component Name] - Step #[X]
- **Status**: Completed
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Completed By**: [Your ID]
- **Changes**: 
  - [List specific removals with file paths]
  - [Include before/after code snippets for significant changes]
- **Verification**: 
  - [How you verified the application still works]
- **Issues**: 
  - [Any issues encountered and how they were resolved]
```

## Remember

Your job is to REMOVE complexity, not add new systems. Every line of code you write should be removing something, not adding or replacing functionality.

When in doubt, REMOVE the code in question and document what was removed. The goal is simplification through removal, not reimplementation.
