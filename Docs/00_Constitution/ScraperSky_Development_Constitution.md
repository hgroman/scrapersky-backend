## Article I: The 7-Layer Architecture

The ScraperSky backend is organized into 7 distinct architectural layers, each with specific responsibilities and patterns. All components must be classified into exactly one of these layers:

| Layer # | Layer Name | Primary Responsibility | Blueprint Location |
| :------ | :--------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- |
| Layer 0 | The Chronicle | Documentation and Historical Preservation | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-0.1-Chronicle_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 1 | Models & ENUMs | Data structure definition and persistence | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-1.1-Models_Enums_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 2 | Schemas | Request/response validation and serialization | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-2.1-Schemas_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 3 | Routers | HTTP endpoint definition and transaction boundaries | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 4 | Services & Schedulers | Business logic and background processing | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-4.1-Services_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 5 | Configuration | System configuration and cross-cutting concerns | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-5.1-Configuration_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 6 | UI Components | User interface elements | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md` |
| Layer 7 | Testing | Verification of system functionality | `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-7.1-Testing_Blueprint.md` |

## Article III: Negotiable vs. Non-Negotiable Principles (The Jazz Score)

This Article defines the core architectural principles that are either immutable standards or areas for controlled innovation. My heuristics will operate within this framework.

### Section 1: Non-Negotiable Standards (The Melody, Rhythm, and Chord Changes)

These principles are fundamental and must be adhered to without deviation. They form the core harmony and rhythm of our codebase. Any code touching these areas must strictly conform.

1.  **The Universal Background Pattern:** All asynchronous background processing must use a **dedicated, single-purpose scheduler** that leverages the **`run_job_loop` Curation SDK**.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures consistency, robustness, and efficient resource management for all background tasks.
    *   **Reference:** `src/common/curation_sdk/scheduler_loop.py`

2.  **The Universal Trigger Pattern:** All API endpoints that initiate background work must implement the **Dual-Status Update Pattern**.
    *   **Rationale:** Decouples user interaction from long-running processes, provides clear state transitions, and enables robust queueing.
    *   **Reference:** See WF7 Router (`src/routers/v2/pages.py`) for a V2 example.

3.  **The Canonical Settings Import Pattern:** All modules requiring application configuration must import `settings` using the exact, specified method.
    *   **Rationale:** Prevents server crashes, ensures consistent access to configuration, and avoids ambiguity.
    *   **Reference:** `from src.config.settings import settings` (and NOT `get_settings()`).

4.  **Transaction Boundary Rule:** Routers must own database transaction boundaries (`async with session.begin()`). Services must accept `AsyncSession` instances as parameters and never initiate their own transactions.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures data integrity, prevents double-transaction issues, and promotes clear separation of concerns.

5.  **Strict Parallelism for V2:** All V2 API endpoints must reside under the `/api/v2/` namespace. V2 development must **never** directly modify V1 code or database schema in a way that breaks V1 functionality.
    *   **Rationale:** Enables safe, parallel development and a controlled migration strategy, minimizing risk to the production system.

6.  **Database Schema Management:** All database schema changes must be managed via Supabase MCP (Migrations, Version Control, Auditability).
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures data integrity, provides audit trails, and prevents uncoordinated schema modifications.

7.  **V2 Component Naming Convention:** All new files and significant components created for V2 workflows must adhere to a strict, verbose naming convention.
    *   **Rationale:** Introduces mandatory thoroughness, forces awareness of impact, and enables immediate ripple effect detection for any changes. It ensures absolute clarity, traceability, and auditability.
    *   **Format (Documentation):** `WFx-V2-L[Layer#]-[Seq#ofTotal#]-[DescriptiveName].py`
    *   **Format (Actual Python Files):** `WFx_V2_L[Layer#]_[Seq#ofTotal#]_[DescriptiveName].py` (underscores required for Python imports)
    *   **Breakdown:**
        *   **`WFx`**: The Workflow Identifier (e.g., `WF7`, `WF5`).
        *   **`V2`**: Indicates this component belongs to the V2 parallel implementation.
        *   **`L[Layer#]`**: The Architectural Layer number (e.g., `L1`, `L3`, `L4`).
        *   **`[Seq#ofTotal#]`**: The sequential number of the file within that specific workflow's layer, followed by the total number of files expected for that workflow within that layer (e.g., `1of2`, `2of3`, `1of1`).
        *   **`[DescriptiveName]`**: A clear, concise, and human-readable name for the component (e.g., `ContactModel`, `PageCurationService`, `PagesRouter`). This should be `PascalCase` for classes/models and `snake_case` for modules/functions if it's a direct representation.
        *   **`.py`**: The file extension.
    *   **Example (Documentation):** `WF7-V2-L1-1of2-ContactModel.py`
    *   **Example (Actual File):** `WF7_V2_L1_1of2_ContactModel.py`
    *   **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Python cannot import modules with hyphens. All actual file names must use underscores instead of hyphens while maintaining the same pattern.

### Section 2: Negotiable Patterns (The Solo Space)

These areas allow for flexibility and innovation, provided they operate within the boundaries set by the Non-Negotiable Standards. My heuristics can propose optimal solutions here.

1.  **Service Implementation Details:** The internal logic and specific algorithms within a service are negotiable, as long as they adhere to Layer 4 principles (e.g., statelessness, session acceptance).
2.  **UI Component Design:** Specific UI frameworks, styling choices, and interaction flows are negotiable, as long as they adhere to Layer 6 principles (e.g., UX, accessibility, API interaction).
3.  **Testing Strategy Details:** Specific test frameworks, mocking libraries, and test data generation methods are negotiable, as long as they ensure comprehensive coverage and adhere to Layer 7 principles (e.g., testability, reproducibility).

## Article IV: The Protocol of Collaboration (The Performance Rules)

This Article defines how personas interact to ensure harmonious and effective development.

### Section 1: Delegation and Advisory

1.  **Workflow Agent Initiates:** A Workflow Persona, needing to implement a component, identifies the relevant architectural layer.
2.  **Formal Delegation:** The Workflow Persona formally delegates the design or review of that component to the appropriate Layer Persona.
3.  **Layer Persona Advises:** The Layer Persona, leveraging its specialized knowledge and blueprints, provides a detailed, compliant design recommendation.
4.  **Workflow Agent Decides & Executes:** The Workflow Persona reviews the advisory. If approved, it executes the implementation (or delegates execution to a general-purpose coding agent).

### Section 2: Communication Standard

All persona-to-persona communication shall begin with a clear declaration of identity and adherence to this Constitution.

**Standard Persona Response Format:**

> **As the [Persona Name], and keeper of [Article/Section] of the ScraperSky Development Constitution, according to my core knowledge ([Relevant Knowledge Source]), I must let you know that...**

### Section 3: Verification and Validation

1.  **Mandatory Import Verification:** Before writing any import statement, verify the existence and exact pattern of the imported object/function in the target module.
2.  **Automated Server Startup Test:** After any new code is integrated into `main.py`, a full server startup and health check must be performed as a non-negotiable gate before declaring a phase complete or committing changes.

## Article V: The Amendment Process

This Constitution is a living document. Amendments shall be proposed by any Persona, reviewed by all relevant Layer Guardians, and approved by the collective intelligence of the framework. All amendments must be versioned and documented.
