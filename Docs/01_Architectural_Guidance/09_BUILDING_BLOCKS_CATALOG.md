# [DEPRECATED] Building Blocks Catalog

**This document is deprecated and will be removed in a future update.**

Its purpose has been superseded by a new, more robust system:

1.  **For Machine-Readable Code Templates:**
    The single source of truth for battle-tested code patterns is now the YAML file:
    `09_BUILDING_BLOCKS_MENU.yaml`

2.  **For Human-Readable Guides:**
    Specific, actionable guidance is now located in the `developer_guides/` directory.
    *   `developer_guides/SCRAPERSKY_DATABASE_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`

This change separates machine-readable data from human-readable documentation, which was a key lesson from our recent architectural reviews.
