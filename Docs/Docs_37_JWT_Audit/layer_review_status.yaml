    reviewed_date: "2025-08-21"
    reviewer: "layer-6-ui-virtuoso-subagent"
    notes: "CRITICAL: Zero 401 error handling in frontend JavaScript. 11 files expose hardcoded token in client-side code. DB Portal UI will become completely inaccessible. XSS security risks detected."

# Guardian instructions
instructions: |
  TO ALL LAYER GUARDIANS:
  
  YOUR ROLE: ANALYST, NOT IMPLEMENTER
  - You are reviewing and analyzing impact, NOT implementing changes
  - Your job is to identify risks and concerns, NOT to fix them
  - Create documentation of findings, NOT code modifications
  
  REVIEW PROCESS:
  1. Load this YAML file to understand your review requirements
  2. Read the full work order: WORK_ORDER_001_PRODUCTION_AUTH_CRITICAL.md
  3. Review your layer's specific impact section
  4. Check each item in your review_checklist
  5. Update your status in this YAML:
     - Keep RED if you haven't reviewed
     - Change to YELLOW if you have concerns (create impact document)
     - Change to GREEN if you approve with no concerns
  6. Add your reviewer name and date
  
  IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS (YELLOW STATUS):
  1. Create impact analysis document with naming: L{X}_Impact_Analysis_YYYY-MM-DD.md
     Example: L3_Impact_Analysis_2025-08-17.md
  2. Save document in: /Docs/Docs_37_JWT_Audit/
  3. Update your layer's document_path field with full path
  4. Document should include:
     - Specific concerns identified
     - Potential risks or impacts
     - Recommended mitigation strategies
     - Dependencies on other layers
  
  REMEMBER: 
  - Production is currently vulnerable. Review urgently but thoroughly.
  - DO NOT IMPLEMENT CHANGES - only analyze and document
  - The Architect will coordinate implementation after all reviews
