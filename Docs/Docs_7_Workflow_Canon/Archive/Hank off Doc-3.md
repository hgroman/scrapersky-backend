# Handoff Document - Workflow Analysis & Page Curation Planning

**Date:** 2025-05-05
**From:** Previous Assistant Session
**To:** Incoming Assistant

## 1. Context

This session began by troubleshooting a 307 redirect / database error occurring specifically within the "Domain Curation" UI tab (related to Workflow WF4). The root cause was identified as incorrect filter application logic within the count query in `src/routers/domains.py`.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

- **Bug Fix:** The count query logic in `src/routers/domains.py::list_domains` was corrected.
- **Code Quality:** Pre-commit hook errors (`ruff` linting, formatting) in `src/routers/domains.py` were addressed.
- **Version Control:** The fix was committed locally (bypassing hooks for known `B008` issues) and pushed to the remote `origin/main` branch.
- **New Workflow Planning (WF7 - Page Curation):** We initiated the process of defining a new CRUD workflow for the `pages` table, mirroring existing patterns.
  - Created specification draft: `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/47.2-CRUD-Specification-for-pages.table.md`
  - Created questionnaire: `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/47.3-Questionnaire.md`
  - Answered questionnaire items using provided CSV data (`pages_rows.csv`) and database enum query results.
  - Documented relevant architectural principles: `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/47.0-guiding architectural principles.md` (aligned with `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/17-CORE_ARCHITECTURAL_PRINCIPLES.md`).
- **Workflow Pattern Analysis:** Created a detailed comparative table mapping components and steps across existing workflows WF1-WF6: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflow-comparison-detailed.md`.
  - This table was iteratively refined to include: Source Table, UI JS File, HTML Tab ID, API Schema, API Router, Core Logic Location/Service, DB Models, Status Fields (Primary & Queueing), Status Enums (Python & DB), Background Scheduler, Processing Service, Output Model, Destination Insert Service.
  - Confirmed required Database Enum Types based on operational code and user-provided list.

## 3. Current Objective & State

The primary goal now is to use the detailed workflow comparison table (`workflow-comparison-detailed.md`) as a definitive blueprint.

- **Current State:** The table structure is mostly complete, mapping files/components across WF1-WF6 and providing placeholders for the new WF7 (Page Curation).
- **Immediate Next Step (User Goal):** Establish standardized, functional labels for each row (step) in the comparison table. This will provide a common vocabulary.
- **Following Step (User Goal):** Map the documented architectural principles (e.g., ORM Required, Authentication Boundary) to these standardized functional steps within the table or a related document. This aims to ensure architectural consistency when building WF7 or future workflows.

## 4. Key Artifacts

- `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflow-comparison-detailed.md` (Primary focus)
- `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/` (Directory containing WF7 planning docs)
- `src/routers/domains.py` (Contains the recent bug fix)
- `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/` (Contains core architectural principle documents)

## 5. Notes for Incoming Assistant

- The user is focused on establishing clear patterns and ensuring architectural consistency.
- Refer to the `workflow-comparison-detailed.md` table as the central reference point for understanding workflow structure.
- The next logical step involves defining functional labels for the rows in that table, followed by mapping principles to those steps.
- Be precise and rely on the established artifacts and conversation history.
- Manual database migrations are required (Alembic is broken). Pay close attention to required DB Enum Types.
