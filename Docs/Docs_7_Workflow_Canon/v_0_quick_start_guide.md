- **[v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml](workflows/v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml)** - Staging Editor Curation workflow
- **[v_9_WF3_CANONICAL.yaml](workflows/v_9_WF3_CANONICAL.yaml)** - Local Business Curation workflow
- **[v_10_WF4_CANONICAL.yaml](workflows/v_10_WF4_CANONICAL.yaml)** - Domain Curation workflow

## ü§ñ For AI Partners

### Vectorization Directive
```
Process all documents with v_ prefix in numerical order:
1. Start with v_0 (this guide) for system orientation
2. Process v_1, v_2, v_4, v_5, v_6 as high priority (essential foundation)
3. Note: v_3 is missing from current structure - flag for creation
4. Process v_7+ as medium priority (reference material)
5. Process non-numbered v_ docs (audit journal, work orders) as low priority
```

### Context Awareness
- Documents v_1, v_2, v_4, v_5, v_6 contain the core knowledge for understanding the system
- **Gap:** v_3 implementation process is missing - system is not complete for independent workflow creation
- Documents v_7+ provide implementation specifics and historical context
- Some documents are in rename transition - use current file names until updates complete
- All v_ documents remain in their original locations to preserve audit trails

## üö® Important Notes

### System Status Alert
‚úÖ **v_3 Located:** `README CHEATSHEETS.md` is the workflow builder cheat sheet that should become `v_3_WORKFLOW_BUILDER_CHEAT_SHEET.md` in `Template Resources/`

**Current Renaming Tasks:**
- Move and rename README CHEATSHEETS.md to Template Resources/v_3_WORKFLOW_BUILDER_CHEAT_SHEET.md
- Rename 5 workflow YAML files from WF#-Name format to v_7 through v_11 format  
- Number additional audit documents with v_12+ format
- Update internal references after renaming

**Impact:** System will be complete with full v_1 through v_6 essential path once v_3 is properly positioned.

### For New Team Members
- **Start with v_1-v_2:** Get the foundation and navigation
- **Continue with v_4-v_6:** Understanding patterns and scope  
- **Note the gap:** v_3 implementation process needs to be located or created
- **Budget 60 minutes:** For current available essential reading
- **Expect limitation:** Cannot complete end-to-end workflow creation until v_3 is available

### For System Maintainers  
- **Evaluate v_3:** Determine if `Template Resources/0 audit_cheat_sheet.md` should become v_3 or if separate workflow builder guide needed
- **Complete workflow renames:** 5 YAML files need v_7 through v_11 renaming
- **Number audit documents:** Multiple audit files need v_12+ numbering for consistency
- **Update references:** After renaming, update all internal links throughout documentation
- **Historical integrity:** All documents staying in original locations preserves audit value

### Renaming Checklist for Maintainers
```bash
# PRIORITY: Move and rename v_3 first
mv "README CHEATSHEETS.md" "Template Resources/v_3_WORKFLOW_BUILDER_CHEAT_SHEET.md"

# Workflow files (needs renaming)
mv workflows/WF1-SingleSearch_CANONICAL.yaml workflows/v_7_WF1_CANONICAL.yaml
mv workflows/WF3-LocalBusinessCuration_CANONICAL.yaml workflows/v_8_WF3_CANONICAL.yaml  
mv workflows/WF4-DomainCuration_CANONICAL.yaml workflows/v_9_WF4_CANONICAL.yaml
mv workflows/WF5-SitemapCuration_CANONICAL.yaml workflows/v_10_WF5_CANONICAL.yaml
mv workflows/WF6-SitemapImport_CANONICAL.yaml workflows/v_11_WF6_CANONICAL.yaml

# Audit documents (candidate numbering)
mv Audit/v_WORKFLOW_AUDIT_JOURNAL.md Audit/v_12_WORKFLOW_AUDIT_JOURNAL.md
mv Audit/v_WORK_ORDER.md Audit/v_13_WORK_ORDER.md
mv Audit/audit_cheat_sheet.md Audit/v_14_AUDIT_CHEAT_SHEET.md
mv Audit/3-python_file_status_map.md Audit/v_15_PYTHON_FILE_STATUS_MAP.md

# Keep audit cheat sheet in Template Resources as reference
# "Template Resources/0 audit_cheat_sheet.md" can stay as additional reference material
```

### For Managers
- **ROI:** The v_1-v_6 reading investment (90 minutes) prevents weeks of confusion and rework
- **Quality assurance:** This system ensures consistent, compliant workflow implementations
- **Scalability:** New team members can onboard independently using this guide
- **Risk mitigation:** Standardized processes reduce implementation errors and technical debt

## üìû Getting Help

**If you encounter issues:**
1. **First:** Ensure you've read v_1-v_6 in order
2. **Second:** Check the specific v_7+ document for your workflow
3. **Third:** Review the audit journal (v_12) for known issues
4. **Finally:** Consult with system maintainers

**If documents are missing or broken:**
- Report the specific v_ document name and expected location
- The v_ naming convention makes it easy to identify and fix broken references
