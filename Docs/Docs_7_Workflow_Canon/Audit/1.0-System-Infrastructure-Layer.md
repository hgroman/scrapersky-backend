# System Infrastructure Layer

This document catalogs the core system infrastructure files of the ScraperSky backend. These files are essential for the application's functionality but aren't directly associated with specific business workflows. They provide the foundation upon which all workflows run.

## Core Infrastructure Files [SYSTEM]

| # | File Path | Description | Used By |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/main.py` | Main application entry point, FastAPI instance initialization and router registration | All components |
| 2 | `src/scheduler_instance.py` | APScheduler initialization for background tasks | Background services |
| 3 | `src/db/engine.py` | Database engine configuration | Database connections |
| 4 | `src/db/session.py` | Session management and connection pooling | All database access |
| 5 | `src/config/settings.py` | Application configuration and environment variables | All components |

## Configuration Files [SYSTEM]

| # | File Path | Description | Used By |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/config/logging_config.py` | Logging configuration and setup | All components |
| 2 | `src/config/runtime_tracer.py` | Runtime tracing utilities for debugging and performance monitoring | Development tools |

## Monitoring & Health [SYSTEM]

| # | File Path | Description | Used By |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/health/__init__.py` | Health check package initialization | Health endpoints |
| 2 | `src/health/db_health.py` | Database connectivity health checks | Health endpoints |

## Package Structure Files [SYSTEM]

The following `__init__.py` files are required for Python package structure:

| # | File Path | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `src/__init__.py` | Root package initialization |
| 2 | `src/auth/__init__.py` | Authentication package initialization |
| 3 | `src/common/__init__.py` | Common utilities package initialization |
| 4 | `src/core/__init__.py` | Core components package initialization |
| 5 | `src/db/__init__.py` | Database package initialization |
| 6 | `src/models/__init__.py` | Models package initialization |
| 7 | `src/routers/__init__.py` | Routers package initialization |
| 8 | `src/scraper/__init__.py` | Scraper components package initialization |
| 9 | `src/services/__init__.py` | Services package initialization |
| 10 | `src/services/batch/__init__.py` | Batch processing package initialization |
| 11 | `src/services/core/__init__.py` | Core services package initialization |
| 12 | `src/services/page_scraper/__init__.py` | Page scraper package initialization |
| 13 | `src/services/places/__init__.py` | Places service package initialization |
| 14 | `src/services/sitemap/__init__.py` | Sitemap service package initialization |
| 15 | `src/services/storage/__init__.py` | Storage service package initialization |

## SDK Components [ARCHIVED]

The following SDK components have been archived as they are no longer used in the active codebase:

| # | Original File Path | Current Location | Notes |
|---|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | `src/common/curation_sdk/router_base.py` | `archive/router_base.py` | Moved to archive directory |
| 2 | `src/common/curation_sdk/status_queue_helper.py` | `archive/status_queue_helper.py` | Moved to archive directory |

## Testing Files [MOVED]

The following test files have been moved to the appropriate test directory:

| # | Original File Path | Current Location | Notes |
|---|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | `src/services/batch/simple_task_test.py` | `tests/simple_task_test.py` | Moved to dedicated test directory |

## Notes on System Files

1. **Architectural Mandate**: These files implement the architectural principle that "JWT authentication happens ONLY at API gateway endpoints, while database operations NEVER handle JWT or tenant authentication."

2. **Database Connection Standards**: All database connections must follow the ONE AND ONLY ONE acceptable method for database connections: FastAPI dependency injection using get_session_dependency.

3. **Package Structure Requirements**: All `__init__.py` files are essential for proper Python package imports and should never be removed.

4. **Configuration Files**: The `settings.py` file contains critical configuration for Supabase connection, including the required username format (`postgres.[project-ref]`), SSL context configuration, and pgbouncer compatibility settings.

5. **Health Monitoring**: The health check endpoints are essential for production monitoring and should be maintained even if not directly referenced in business workflows.
