# Orphaned Python Files Audit

**AUDIT STATUS: COMPLETED ✅ - Last Updated: 2025-05-05**

This document tracked Python files that existed in the source code but were not referenced in any workflow documentation. All identified orphaned files have now been properly addressed.

## Remaining Orphaned/Misreferenced Files

None - All orphaned files have been resolved

## Actions Completed

The audit process has been completed with the following actions taken:

1. **System Infrastructure Documentation:**
   - All essential system infrastructure and package structure files have been properly documented in `1.0-System-Infrastructure-Layer.md`
   - All `__init__.py` files are now cataloged as essential [SYSTEM] files

2. **Files Moved to Archive:**
   - `src/common/curation_sdk/router_base.py` → Moved to `archive/router_base.py`
   - `src/common/curation_sdk/status_queue_helper.py` → Moved to `archive/status_queue_helper.py`

3. **Files Moved to Tests:**
   - `src/services/batch/simple_task_test.py` → Moved to `tests/simple_task_test.py`

4. **File Naming Corrections:**
   - The file previously referenced as `src/services/page_scraper/page_scraper_service.py` was found to be correctly named as `src/services/page_scraper/processing_service.py`
   - All documentation has been updated to reference the correct filename

5. **Documentation Updates:**
   - `0-A-ALL-PYTHON-FILES-IN-SRC.md`: Updated to reflect current files in the src directory
   - `0-B-PYTHON-FILE-LIST.md`: Updated to include all files with proper categorization
   - `1.0-System-Infrastructure-Layer.md`: Updated to reflect moved files
   - Various documentation files: Corrected references to renamed files

## Verification

A complete verification has been performed to ensure:

1. All Python files in the source directory are properly documented
2. No files are listed in documentation that don't exist in the source
3. All files are appropriately categorized in the system architecture layers

## Note on File Organization

With the completion of this audit, the ScraperSky backend codebase now has a clean, accurate documentation structure that correctly reflects the state of all files, with no orphans remaining. The files are properly categorized across the three architectural layers:

- System Infrastructure Layer
- API Router Layer
- Background Processing Layer

This organization improves maintainability and reduces technical debt by ensuring all files are properly tracked and documented.
