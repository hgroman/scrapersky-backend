## Workflow Builder Cheat Sheets

This repository contains three versions of the Workflow Builder Cheat Sheet, each serving a different purpose:

- **OVER-ENGINEERED**: For designing complex or novel workflows that require deep architectural consideration. Provides extensive planning guidance and ensures alignment with system principles.

- **TEMPLATE**: The standard version for most workflow implementations. Balances comprehensive guidance with practical templates for efficient implementation.

- **SUPER SHORT**: A quick reference for experienced developers implementing straightforward workflows. Contains just the essential steps and code snippets.

All three enforce the same producer-consumer pattern and architectural standards while providing different levels of detail.
