# Micro Work Order: WF4-Domain Curation Workflow Audit

_Last updated: 2025-05-05T00:25:32-07:00_

## Objective
To perform a bulletproof, fully auditable documentation and artifact audit for the Domain Curation workflow (WF4), ensuring all steps are explicit, repeatable, and context-free for any future AI or human auditor.

---

## Step-by-Step Protocol

### 1. Reference Templates
- [x] Use this template for every workflow audit.
- [x] Reference completed examples for structure and rigor.
- [x] All timestamps must use ISO8601 format with timezone for audit traceability.
- [x] If any checklist item is not completed, a documented exception must be added to the Known Issues / Exception Log.
- [x] If new best practices or ambiguities are discovered during any workflow audit, update this template and the cheat sheet immediately for future clarity.
- [x] All issues, technical debt, and exceptions must be referenced in both the micro work order and the master WORK_ORDER.md audit log for traceability.
  - Dependency Trace: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/4-Domain Curation.md`
  - Linear Steps: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Linear-Steps/WF4-DomainCuration_linear_steps.md`
  - Canonical YAML: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF4-DomainCuration_CANONICAL.yaml`

### 2. Dependency Trace Audit
- [x] Open: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/4-Domain Curation.md`
- [x] Confirm all files, functions, and components are listed and described (UI, routers, services, models, background jobs, etc.)
- [x] Annotate each referenced file as [NOVEL] or [SHARED] (see 3-python_file_status_map.md for authoritative status)
- [x] Ensure the dependency trace covers the workflow from UI to DB and background jobs
- [x] If any files are missing, update the dependency trace to match the template structure

### 3. Linear Steps Document
- [x] Reviewed: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Linear-Steps/WF4-DomainCuration_linear_steps.md`
- [x] Map each step in the workflow from UI to DB, referencing all files and actions
- [x] Annotate each file as [NOVEL] or [SHARED]
- [x] Reference all architectural principles and guides
- [x] Ensure the atomic steps table is up to date and complete

### 4. Canonical YAML Audit
- [x] Open: `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF4-DomainCuration_CANONICAL.yaml`
- [x] Ensure all steps, files, and principles are in 1:1 sync with the linear steps doc
- [x] Explicitly annotate ORM enforcement and architectural mandates for all DB steps
- [x] Reference all relevant architectural guides
- [x] Validate the YAML against the established schema
- [x] Checklist for background task compliance:
    - [x] Idempotency - Verified in domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py
    - [x] Retry Logic - Verified with per-domain transaction handling
    - [x] Explicit transaction boundaries - Verified with per-domain transactions
    - [x] Logging and error handling - Comprehensive try/except with logging

### 5. Producer-Consumer Pattern Verification
- [x] Verify that WF4 follows the producer-consumer pattern documented in PRODUCER_CONSUMER_WORKFLOW_PATTERN.md
- [x] Validate that WF4 acts as a producer for WF5-SitemapCuration
  - Production signal: Setting sitemap_analysis_status = "Queued" in domains table
  - Connection point: src/routers/domains.py::update_domain_sitemap_curation_status_batch → src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py::process_pending_sitemap_submissions
- [x] Validate that WF4 acts as a consumer of WF3-LocalBusinessCuration
  - Consumption signal: Reading local_businesses records with domain_extraction_status = "Queued"
  - Connection point: src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py::process_pending_jobs → src/services/business_to_domain_service.py::process_single_business
- [x] Ensure connection points are explicitly documented in both canonical YAML and dependency trace

### 6. Cross-Reference and Sync
- [x] Confirm all files and principles are mirrored across dependency trace, linear steps, and YAML
- [x] Ensure there are no orphaned or ambiguous files
- [x] Update `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/3-python_file_status_map.md` with any new or changed files, annotating [NOVEL]/[SHARED] as appropriate

### 6. Artifact Tracker and Progress Log
- [x] Mark artifact completion for this workflow in `WORK_ORDER.md`
- [x] Add a timestamped progress entry summarizing the audit in `WORK_ORDER.md`

### 7. Signoff
- [x] All steps above are checked/completed, or exceptions are documented
- [x] Reviewer signs and dates the micro work order

## Audit Findings

### Architectural Patterns
1. **Dual-Status Update Pattern** - Confirmed implementation in this workflow:
   - When `sitemap_curation_status` is set to "Selected", the code automatically sets `sitemap_analysis_status` to "Queued".
   - Follows the same pattern as found in WF2 and WF3, further validating this as a standardized pattern.
   - Implementation uses proper ORM (unlike WF2 which used raw SQL).

### API Compliance
1. The API endpoint correctly uses the `/api/v3/` prefix as required by the API standardization mandate.
2. Authentication uses the proper `get_current_user` dependency at the API boundary.

### Database Compliance
1. **Full ORM Compliance** - All database operations use SQLAlchemy ORM as required.
2. **Transaction Management** - Router properly owns the transaction boundary with explicit commit/rollback.

### Background Job Implementation
1. **Transaction Isolation** - Each domain is processed in its own transaction, preventing cascading failures.
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling prevents job failures from affecting other jobs.
3. **Status Updates** - Clear status transitions (Queued -> Processing -> Completed/Error).

### Known Issues
1. **Direct API Call to Internal Endpoint** (Severity: LOW)
   - The adapter service makes a direct HTTP call to another internal endpoint.
   - Jira: SCRSKY-232
   - Remediation: Consider moving to service-to-service communication pattern.

2. **Hardcoded Internal API URL** (Severity: LOW)
   - The adapter service has a hardcoded `INTERNAL_API_BASE_URL`.
   - Jira: SCRSKY-233
   - Remediation: Move to configuration settings.

## Notes for Future Auditors
- The domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py makes an HTTP request to another internal endpoint, which is an unusual pattern worth reviewing.
- This workflow implements the Dual-Status Update Pattern seen in multiple workflows, which should be formalized as an architectural pattern.
- All timestamps use ISO8601 format with timezone for audit traceability.
