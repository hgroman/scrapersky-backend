# Micro Work Order: WF1-SingleSearch Workflow Audit

_Last updated: 2025-05-05T08:00:25-07:00_

## Objective

Perform a comprehensive audit of the WF1-SingleSearch workflow to ensure complete, accurate, and standardized documentation that aligns with project architectural principles and follows the enhanced documentation standards established in WF5 and WF6 audits.

---

## Protocol Followed

### 1. Dependency Trace Audit

- [x] Reviewed `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/WF1-Single Search.md`
- [x] Confirmed all files, functions, and components are listed and described
- [x] Verified the dependency trace covers the workflow from Layer 6: UI Components to DB
- [x] Identified missing NOVEL/SHARED annotations
- [x] Verified workflow pattern and connections to downstream processes

### 2. Linear Steps Audit

- [x] Reviewed `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Linear-Steps/WF1-SingleSearch_linear_steps.md`
- [x] Verified steps map the workflow from Layer 6: UI Components to DB
- [x] Identified missing NOVEL/SHARED annotations
- [x] Confirmed architectural principles and guides are referenced
- [x] Verified atomic steps table is present but needs updating

### 3. Canonical YAML Audit

- [x] Reviewed `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF1-SingleSearch_CANONICAL.yaml`
- [x] Identified structural issues with duplicate/conflicting phases
- [x] Verified ORM enforcement annotations
- [x] Identified missing architectural guide references
- [x] Found missing workflow connections section
- [x] Found missing actionable TODOs and known issues sections

### 4. Cross-Reference and Sync

- [x] Verified core files are consistently referenced across documents
- [x] Identified inconsistencies in principles between linear steps and YAML
- [x] Checked for orphaned or ambiguous files
- [x] Verified `3-python_file_status_map.md` includes WF1 components

### 5. Documentation Enhancement

- [x] Added producer-consumer pattern terminology
- [x] Added actionable TODOs with tickets and target dates
- [x] Added workflow connections section
- [x] Fixed YAML structure inconsistencies
- [x] Updated timestamp and reviewer information
- [ ] Reviewer signs and dates the micro work order

## Findings

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Inconsistent YAML Structure**

   - **Severity**: HIGH
   - **Description**: The canonical YAML file contained duplicated phases with different step IDs (appeared to have both a completed section and a "TODO" section mixed together).
   - **Resolution**: Removed duplicate phases and consolidated into a single, coherent structure.

2. **Missing Actionable TODOs**

   - **Severity**: MEDIUM
   - **Description**: Unlike our updated WF6 documentation, there was no dedicated section for clear, actionable TODOs.
   - **Resolution**: Added dedicated `known_issues` and `documentation_todos` sections with ticket IDs, target dates, and files to modify.

3. **Workflow Integration Pattern Not Documented**

   - **Severity**: MEDIUM
   - **Description**: The producer-consumer pattern and workflow connections were not clearly documented.
   - **Resolution**: Added a `workflow_connections` section describing how WF1 produces data for WF2.

4. **Inconsistent File Annotations**
   - **Severity**: LOW
   - **Description**: NOVEL/SHARED annotations were inconsistently applied across documents.
   - **Resolution**: Verified and added proper annotations in the dependency trace.

### Technical Debt Items

1. **Raw SQL Query Violation**

   - **Description**: Raw SQL query was found in places_storage_service.py, violating the ABSOLUTE_ORM_REQUIREMENT.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-225
   - **Target Date**: 2025-05-10
   - **Files to Modify**: src/services/places/places_storage_service.py

2. **Hardcoded Connection Parameters**

   - **Description**: Connection parameters are hardcoded in places_service.py rather than using the settings module.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-226
   - **Target Date**: 2025-05-15
   - **Files to Modify**: src/services/places/places_service.py, src/config/settings.py

3. **Missing Transaction Boundary**

   - **Description**: API Layer 3: Routers lacks explicit transaction boundary as required by architectural principles.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-250
   - **Target Date**: 2025-05-15
   - **Files to Modify**: src/routers/google_maps_api.py

4. **Insufficient Error Handling**
   - **Description**: Limited error handling for API failures was found in Layer 4: Services.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-251
   - **Target Date**: 2025-05-18
   - **Files to Modify**: src/services/places/places_service.py

### Documentation Needs

1. **Missing Guide References**

   - **Description**: Several references to non-existent guides were found in the documentation.
   - **Resolution**: Added TODOs to create these missing guides (error handling, ENUM handling).

2. **Workflow Connection Visualization**
   - **Description**: No visual representation of how WF1 connects to WF2.
   - **Resolution**: Added TODO to update workflow diagrams with this connection.

## Architectural Compliance

1. **API Versioning**

   - **Status**: Compliant
   - **Evidence**: All endpoints use the /api/v3/ prefix as required.

2. **ORM Usage**

   - **Status**: Partially Compliant
   - **Issue**: Raw SQL query found in places_storage_service.py.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-225

3. **Transaction Management**

   - **Status**: Partially Compliant
   - **Issue**: Missing explicit transaction boundary in Layer 3: Routers.
   - **Ticket**: SCRSKY-250

4. **JWT Authentication Boundaries**
   - **Status**: Compliant
   - **Evidence**: Authentication happens at API gateway level only.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the technical debt items identified in this audit, prioritizing the ORM violation.
2. Create the missing architectural guides referenced in the documentation.
3. Update the workflow diagrams to show the connection between WF1 and WF2.
4. Consider extending the enhanced documentation standards to other workflows.
