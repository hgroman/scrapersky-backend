# WF5-Sitemap Curation: Micro Work Order

_Last updated: 2025-05-05T00:45:32-07:00_

## Objective

To audit and document the Sitemap Curation workflow (WF5) where sitemap files are marked as 'Selected' in the Layer 6: UI Components, resulting in them being queued for deep scrape processing.

**Workflow Name:** WF5-Sitemap Curation
**JIRA Assignment:** SCRSKY-206
**Assigned To:** Henry G.
**Requested Due Date:** 2025-05-05
**Status:** COMPLETED

- [x] Added Layer 1: Model and Layer 1: ENUM dependencies

### 5. Cross-Reference and Sync

- [x] Confirmed alignment across all artifacts
- [x] No orphaned files found
- [x] Updated `python_file_status_map.md` with new [NOVEL]/[SHARED] annotations

## DB/ORM Audit Findings

**ORM Standard Compliance:**

- [x] All implemented components use SQLAlchemy ORM correctly
- [x] No raw SQL found in this workflow
- [x] All status transitions properly handled via ORM

**Transaction Boundary Management:**

- [x] Layer 3: Routers properly owns transaction boundaries
- [x] Layer 4: Services correctly designed as transaction-aware
- [x] Background job would have proper transaction boundaries if implemented

**Enum Usage and Consistency:**

- [x] Proper enums used: `SitemapImportCurationStatusEnum` and `SitemapImportProcessStatusEnum`
- [x] Enum values consistent with database definitions
- [x] Status transitions properly enforce allowed values

## Critical Path Verification

- [x] **Layer 6: UI Components Selection to Database Update**: VERIFIED

  - Layer 6: UI Components sends proper request to API endpoint
  - Layer 3: Routers delegates to Layer 4: Services.
  - Layer 4: Services updates database using ORM

- [x] **Database Update to Background Job**: VERIFIED

  - Status update correctly sets sitemap_import_status to 'Queued'
  - VERIFIED: `sitemap_import_scheduler.py` polls for these queued records as part of WF6
  - Clean handoff between workflows using status-based queuing

- [x] **Background Job Execution**: VERIFIED

  - This stage is handled by WF6-Sitemap Import
  - `sitemap_import_service.py` processes the queued sitemap files
  - Proper transaction management and error handling implemented

- [x] **Status Handling for Failures**: VERIFIED
  - Error states defined in model
  - Error handling implemented in the sitemap import Layer 4: Service
  - Status updates correctly managed

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All DB operations use ORM (no raw SQL)
- [x] All status transitions are enforced
- [x] Background job configuration is correct - VERIFIED: Implemented in dedicated scheduler
- [x] Errors are properly handled and logged - VERIFIED: Error handling present in sitemap import service
- [x] Transaction boundaries are properly managed
- [x] All API endpoints follow `/api/v3/` standard
- [x] JWT authentication happens only at API gateway
- [ ] Documentation clearly shows workflow connections - **ISSUE**: Connection to WF6 not documented

## Known Issues

1. ~~**CRITICAL**: Missing implementation in scheduler to process queued sitemap files~~ **RESOLVED**

   - ~~Issue: `sitemap_scheduler.py` does not poll for SitemapFile records with sitemap_import_status='Queued'~~
   - ~~Impact: Selected sitemap files are never processed for deep scraping~~
   - JIRA: SCRSKY-234
   - Resolution: Discovered that a dedicated scheduler (`sitemap_import_scheduler.py`) handles this as part of WF6

2. ~~**HIGH**: Missing deep scrape service implementation~~ **RESOLVED**

   - ~~Issue: No service identified that would process sitemap files for deep scraping~~
   - ~~Impact: Even if scheduler polling was fixed, processing would fail~~
   - JIRA: SCRSKY-235
   - Resolution: Discovered `sitemap_import_service.py` which implements this functionality as part of WF6

3. **MEDIUM**: Documentation gap between WF5 and WF6

   - Issue: The handoff between these workflows is not clearly documented
   - Impact: Confusion about workflow implementation and completeness
   - JIRA: SCRSKY-236
   - Remediation: Add explicit documentation about workflow connections

4. **LOW**: Status field naming inconsistency
   - Issue: Field named 'deep_scrape_curation_status' but related to sitemap import
   - Impact: Potentially confusing naming convention
   - JIRA: SCRSKY-237
   - Remediation: Consider standardizing field names for clarity

## Updated Analysis

This workflow audit initially identified what appeared to be a critical gap in implementation but further investigation revealed a different architectural pattern. The initial concern was that while the Layer 6: UI Components selection and database update are properly implemented following the Dual-Status Update Pattern, there appeared to be no process to pick up the queued items.

Further investigation revealed that unlike other workflows that use the shared `sitemap_scheduler.py`, this workflow intentionally uses a dedicated scheduler:

1. **WF5 (Sitemap Curation)** sets `sitemap_import_status='Queued'`
2. **WF6 (Sitemap Import)** then takes over with:
   - `sitemap_import_scheduler.py` - Dedicated scheduler that polls for the queued records
   - `sitemap_import_service.py` - Processing Layer 4: Service that handles the actual import

This separation of concerns creates a clean workflow boundary but was not clearly documented. Rather than a missing implementation, this represents an intentional architectural decision to separate the curation workflow (WF5) from the processing workflow (WF6).

The apparent "gap" was actually a documentation issue where the connection between these workflows was not explicitly stated, leading to confusion during the audit. This finding demonstrates the importance of documenting not just individual workflows but also their connections and handoff points.
