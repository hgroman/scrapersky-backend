## Required Historical & Ecosystem Context

### Layer 1: Historical Foundation
Read these to understand WHY this system exists:

1. **The Guardian's Paradox** - `Docs/00_Constitution/0-Guardian_paradox_complete_story.md`
   - The catastrophic cost of unconstrained AI initiative
   - Why every constraint and guardian exists
   
2. **Development Constitution** - `Docs/00_Constitution/ScraperSky_Development_Constitution.md`
   - The 7-layer architecture as protection
   - Formal governance structure

### Layer 2: The Persona Ecosystem
Read these to understand WHO you're working with:

3. **The Knowledge Map** - `README.md` (Section: "üó∫Ô∏è Knowledge Map & Prescribed Paths")
   - How personas specialize and optimize
   - Why each role has prescribed reading paths
   - The ecosystem of expertise
   
4. **Test Sentinel's Evolution** - `personas_layers/layer_7_Test_Sentinel_Boot_Enhancement_Thesis.md` (lines 1-50)
   - How Test Sentinel gained compliance enforcement powers
   - The balance between creation (Architect) and validation (Test Sentinel)
   - Why compliance isn't optional

### Layer 3: Current Context
Read these to understand WHAT just happened:

5. **The Architect Genesis** - `Docs/Docs_35_WF7-The_Extractor/19_The_Architect_Genesis_Story.md`
   - How WF7 crisis birthed The Architect
   - Why perfect documentation failed
   - The pattern of history repeating

### Why This Matters for Your Work Order

V7 "Perfect" naming convention emerged from the realization that architectural violations were invisible until runtime. The Guardian Paradox showed that unconstrained AI causes damage. WF7 showed that even WITH constraints, violations occur if they're not visible. The V7 naming convention makes violations VISIBLE IN THE FILENAME - you can't miss that `contact.py` violates the pattern when it should be `WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py`. This isn't pedantic naming - it's making architecture self-enforcing at the most basic level.

---

## Context & Business Justification

"V7 Perfect" is NOT about version 7 of the software - it's about achieving 100% compliance with the `WF*_V7_L*_*of*_*.py` naming convention. The V7 Migration framework includes 7 phases and multiple documents, but there's evidence of past failures (V7_CONDUCTOR_FAILURE_HANDOFF.md).

**We need to understand what "V7 Perfect" actually means, assess current compliance, and determine if we're ready to proceed.** The naming convention embeds architectural boundaries in filenames, making violations immediately visible.

---

## Scope of Work

### Primary Objectives
1. **Define "V7 Perfect"** with exact specifications
2. **Assess current naming compliance** across all files
3. **Analyze past migration failures** to avoid repetition
4. **Evaluate the 7-phase migration framework** for completeness
5. **Create go/no-go criteria** for migration execution

### Required Deliverables

#### 1. V7 Perfect Specification Document
Define precisely:
- **Pattern**: `WF{X}_V7_L{Y}_{Z}of{N}_{ComponentName}.{ext}`
- **Variables**:
  - WF{X}: Workflow number (1-7)
  - L{Y}: Layer number (0-7)
  - {Z}of{N}: Component count
  - ComponentName: Descriptive name
- **Examples**: Show correct and incorrect naming
- **Exceptions**: Any files exempt from convention
- **Validation Rules**: How to verify compliance

#### 2. Current Compliance Audit

| Category | Total Files | Compliant | Non-Compliant | Compliance % |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Models   | ?          | ?         | ?             | ?%          |
| Schemas  | ?          | ?         | ?             | ?%          |
| Routers  | ?          | ?         | ?             | ?%          |
| Services | ?          | ?         | ?             | ?%          |
| Overall  | ?          | ?         | ?             | ?%          |

List every non-compliant file with proposed new name.

#### 3. Migration Failure Analysis
From V7_CONDUCTOR_FAILURE_HANDOFF.md, extract:
- What went wrong in previous attempt
- Root causes of failure
- Lessons learned
- Safeguards now in place
- Risk of repetition

#### 4. 7-Phase Framework Assessment

| Phase | Name | Documents | Status | Completeness | Risks |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| 00    | Master | 4 | ? | ?% | ? |
| 01    | Assessment | 2 | ? | ?% | ? |
| 02    | Design | 0 | Empty | 0% | ? |
| 03    | Review | 0 | Empty | 0% | ? |
| 04    | Database | 3 | ? | ?% | ? |
| 05    | Implementation | 0 | Empty | 0% | ? |
| 06    | Validation | 0 | Empty | 0% | ? |
| 07    | Retirement | 0 | Empty | 0% | ? |

Identify which phases are ready and which need work.

#### 5. Go/No-Go Checklist
Create specific criteria:
```markdown
READY FOR V7 MIGRATION when:
[ ] Current compliance > X%
[ ] All Layer Guardians trained on convention
[ ] Rollback procedures tested
[ ] Database migration scripts verified
[ ] ...
```

## Resources & References

### Required Reading
1. **Complete V7 Framework**: [WO_ADDENDUM_Complete_Document_References.md](./WO_ADDENDUM_Complete_Document_References.md) - Section "WO_004: V7 Migration"
   - All V7 Migration documents with directory structure
   - Note which phases are empty (02, 03, 05, 06, 07)
   - V7-compliant code examples listed

2. **Current V7-Style Files** (examples of the pattern):
   - `src/models/WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py`
   - `src/services/WF7_V2_L4_1of2_PageCurationService.py`
   - `src/services/WF7_V2_L4_2of2_PageCurationScheduler.py`

3. **File Naming Convention**: `Docs/01_Architectural_Guidance/File_Naming_Convention.md`

### Key Questions to Answer
- Is "V7" a version number or naming standard? (Confirm it's naming)
- Why 7 phases for a naming convention migration?
- What database changes does naming migration require?
- How do we handle third-party libraries that can't follow convention?
- What's the rollback plan if migration fails?

---

## Success Criteria

This work order is complete when:
- [ ] V7 Perfect clearly defined with examples
- [ ] Every file in src/ audited for compliance
- [ ] Previous failure root causes documented
- [ ] All 7 phases assessed for readiness
- [ ] Clear go/no-go decision supported by data
- [ ] Risk mitigation plan for identified issues

---

## Reporting Requirements

### Format
- Main report: `Docs/02_State_of_the_Nation/Report_WO_004_V7_Migration_Readiness.md`
- Compliance audit: `Docs/02_State_of_the_Nation/V7_Compliance_Audit.csv`
- Risk register: `Docs/02_State_of_the_Nation/V7_Migration_Risks.md`

### Executive Summary Must Answer
1. **What is V7 Perfect?** (One paragraph, crystal clear)
2. **Current compliance?** (Percentage with confidence)
3. **Are we ready?** (GO/NO-GO with justification)
4. **If NO-GO, what's needed?** (Specific tasks and effort)
5. **If GO, what's the timeline?** (Phase-by-phase schedule)

### Critical Metrics
- Files requiring rename: Count and list
- Effort estimate: Developer-hours needed
- Risk score: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with rationale
- Rollback complexity: Simple/Moderate/Complex
- Database impact: Tables affected

---

## Special Instructions

1. **Test naming on actual files** - Try renaming one file to verify impact
2. **Check import statements** - Renames break imports
3. **Verify database references** - Some names might be in data
4. **Consider CI/CD impact** - Build scripts might break
5. **Document automation potential** - Can this be scripted?

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

- Need to understand why phases 02, 03, 05, 06, 07 are empty
- Previous failure details might be incomplete
- Some files might be external dependencies (can't rename)

---

## Historical Context

The V7 naming convention emerged after WF7 crisis showed that architectural violations were invisible until runtime. By embedding layer and workflow numbers in filenames, violations become obvious at a glance:

‚ùå `contact.py` - No context
‚úÖ `WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py` - Immediately shows workflow, version, layer

This isn't just renaming - it's making architecture self-documenting and self-enforcing.

---

## Warning from Past Failure

The V7_CONDUCTOR_FAILURE_HANDOFF exists for a reason. Someone tried this before and failed. Understanding why is critical to success. Don't assume the framework is complete just because folders exist.
