# V7 Perfect Migration: Master Workflow
## Version: 1.0
## Guardian Paradox Compliant: TRUE
## Status: DRAFT

---

## Executive Summary

The V7 migration represents a complete architectural alignment where:
- Every file follows the `WF*_V7_L*_*of*_*.py` convention
- Every ENUM is consolidated and properly named
- Every component is validated against database reality
- Every change is reviewed for global impact
- Every step can be rolled back

## Guardian's Paradox Covenant

This workflow exists because attempting perfection in isolation caused catastrophe.
We achieve perfection through:
- **Coordination** over initiative
- **Global awareness** over local optimization
- **Reversibility** over permanence
- **Reality** over theory

## Success Criteria

V7 is "perfect" when:
1. ✅ 100% file naming compliance
2. ✅ Zero duplicate ENUMs in database
3. ✅ All code matches database structure
4. ✅ All workflows function without modification
5. ✅ Zero data loss during migration
6. ✅ Full rollback capability maintained
7. ✅ Performance metrics maintained or improved

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Lead | Duration | Status | Start | Complete |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1. Assessment | The Architect | 5 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 2. Design | Layer Guardians | 5 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 3. Review | Workflow Personas | 3 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 4. Database | DB Team + Architect | 2 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 5. Implementation | Dev Team | 10 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 6. Validation | Test Sentinel | 5 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |
| 7. Retirement | The Architect | 30 days | NOT_STARTED | TBD | TBD |

## Communication Protocol

### DART Integration
- Master Dartboard: "V7 Perfect Migration"
- Each phase has dedicated folder
- All decisions documented in DART
- Daily status updates required

### Escalation Path
1. Blocker identified → Task owner
2. Not resolved in 4 hours → Phase lead
3. Not resolved in 24 hours → Architect
4. Critical risk → STOP all work

### Review Gates
Each phase requires approval before proceeding:
- Phase 1 → 2: Database reality documented
- Phase 2 → 3: All proposals complete
- Phase 3 → 4: Global impacts approved
- Phase 4 → 5: Database scripts tested
- Phase 5 → 6: Code complete
- Phase 6 → 7: Tests passing
- Phase 7 → Complete: 30-day stability

## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Database ENUM change breaks production | Medium | Critical | Parallel columns, 
gradual migration |
| File rename breaks imports | High | High | Comprehensive import testing |
| API compatibility broken | Medium | High | Compatibility layer |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Benchmark before/after |
| Rollback needed | Low | Critical | Every change reversible |

## Database Tracking

All progress tracked in:
- `v7_migration_workflow` - Phase status
- `v7_subworkflow_tasks` - Individual tasks
- `file_audit` - File migration status
- `v7_enum_migrations` - ENUM consolidation
- `v7_global_impacts` - Impact assessments
- `v7_test_results` - Test outcomes

## Approval Chain

This workflow requires approval from:
- [ ] The Architect (workflow owner)
- [ ] All Layer Guardians (technical review)
- [ ] All Workflow Personas (business impact)
- [ ] Database Team Lead (migration safety)
- [ ] Test Sentinel (quality assurance)

## Guardian's Paradox Safeguards

1. **No Unilateral Changes**: Every change reviewed by multiple personas
2. **Database Sacred**: Current database documented, changes scripted
3. **Incremental Progress**: Small, reversible steps over big bang
4. **Reality Over Theory**: Current state respected, ideal state planned
5. **Global Awareness**: Every local change assessed globally
