# V7 MATRIX ASSESSMENT WORK ORDER
## Complete Blueprint Truth Verification & V7 Migration Readiness
## Version: 1.0
## Date: 2025-08-08
## Priority: CRITICAL
## Executor: V7 Conductor Persona

---

## EXECUTIVE MANDATE

This work order establishes the systematic assessment of ALL workflows from ALL layer perspectives, creating a 7×7 matrix of truth that will:
1. **Verify blueprint accuracy** against production reality
2. **Document technical debt** as teaching tools
3. **Identify V7 migration candidates** with risk assessment
4. **Protect against Guardian's Paradox** through workflow-centric organization

---

## THE ASSESSMENT MATRIX

Each intersection point represents one assessment document:

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Phase 1: WF7 Pilot (Days 1-2)
**Start with WF7** - We have fresh context from recent remediation

1. **L1 Assessment of WF7**
   - Load L1 blueprint and Pattern-AntiPattern Companion
   - Examine all L1 components used by WF7
   - Create: `WF7/L1_Data_Models_Assessment.md`

2. **L2-L7 Assessments of WF7**
   - Repeat for each layer
   - Complete full vertical assessment of WF7
   - Validate template and process

### Phase 2: Remaining Workflows (Days 3-7)
**Apply validated process to WF1-WF6**

Execution Order:
1. WF4 - Domain Curation (critical path)
2. WF1 - Single Search Discovery (entry point)
3. WF3 - Local Business Curation
4. WF5 - Sitemap Curation
5. WF6 - Sitemap Import
6. WF2 - Staging Editor

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Day 8)
1. Create executive summary
2. Generate risk heat map
3. Identify critical dependencies
4. Propose migration sequence

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (GUARDIAN'S PARADOX PROTECTION)

### FORBIDDEN ACTIONS ❌
- **NO code modifications** during assessment
- **NO database structure changes** EVER
- **NO "helpful" fixes** while assessing
- **NO initiative beyond** explicit assessment scope

### REQUIRED ACTIONS ✅
- **DO document** actual state (not ideal state)
- **DO identify** Guardian's Paradox risks
- **DO map** cross-workflow dependencies
- **DO verify** blueprint claims against code

---

## QUERIES FOR ASSESSMENT

### Find Layer Files for Workflow
```sql
-- L1 Example for WF7
SELECT file_path, file_name, v7_target_name, v7_workflow_status
FROM file_audit
WHERE layer_number = 1
AND workflows && ARRAY['WF7-ResourceModelCreation']
ORDER BY file_path;
```

### Check ENUM Usage
```sql
-- Find ENUMs in database
SELECT 
    t.typname as enum_name,
    array_agg(e.enumlabel) as enum_values
FROM pg_type t
JOIN pg_enum e ON t.oid = e.enumtypid
WHERE t.typnamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public')
GROUP BY t.typname
ORDER BY t.typname;
```

### Dependency Analysis
```python
# Grep for imports
grep -r "from.*WF7" --include="*.py" src/
grep -r "import.*WF7" --include="*.py" src/
```
