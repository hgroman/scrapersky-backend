COMPLETION OF AD_005: V7 DATABASE INFRASTRUCTURE - 2025-08-07
Executive Summary
I have successfully completed Architectural Directive 005 for V7 Database Infrastructure creation. All required deliverables have been created and documented per the Guardian's Paradox safeguards.
Deliverables Completed

1. SQL Script Documentation âœ…
   File: /Docs/V7_Migration/04_Database_Phase/V7_Migration_Tables.sql

- Complete DDL for all V7 tracking tables
- ENUM consolidation tracking for 45+ duplicates identified
- Performance indexes and monitoring views
- Rollback scripts included (Section 9)
- Guardian's Paradox compliance warnings throughout

2.  File: /Docs/V7_Migration/04_Database_Phase/DATABASE_WORKFLOW.md

- Comprehensive 9-section workflow document
- Clear task breakdown with responsible personas
- Verification queries for each phase
- Error handling and rollback protocols
- Approval chain requirements
  Key Insights from MCP Supabase Access
  Having MCP access to Supabase allowed me to:
  Verify no V7 tables currently exist - Clean slate confirmed
  Document actual ENUM duplications - Found examples like:
  contact_curation_status vs contactcurationstatus
  contact_processing_status vs contactprocessingstatus
  Validate file_audit table structure - Confirmed 23 existing columns
  Design compatible ALTER TABLE statements - Using IF NOT EXISTS clauses
  Database Components Designed
  Tables (5)
  v7_migration_workflow - 7-phase tracking
  v7_enum_migrations - ENUM consolidation
  v7_global_impacts - Cross-layer impact assessment
  v7_subworkflow_tasks - Granular task tracking
  v7_test_results - Quality assurance metrics
  Enhancements (1)
  file_audit - 12 new V7-specific columns
  Views (3)
  v7_migration_dashboard - Executive overview
  v7_enum_consolidation_status - ENUM merge progress
  v7_file_migration_readiness - Layer-by-layer status
  Indexes (6)
  Performance optimizations for all status columns
  Guardian's Paradox Compliance
  The deliverables strictly adhere to Guardian's Paradox principles:
  NO autonomous execution - Scripts documented but NOT executed
  Explicit warnings throughout - "DO NOT EXECUTE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION"
  Complete rollback capability - Section 9 of SQL script
  Reality over theory - Based on actual database analysis via MCP
  Approval gates - Multiple sign-offs required before execution
  Readiness Status
  I am READY to execute the SQL scripts upon approval from The Architect.
  However, per Guardian's Paradox and AD_005 Article 2.4:
  "DO NOT execute these SQL scripts against the Supabase database without explicit approval from The Architect."
  Next Steps
  Await review and approval from The Architect
  Upon approval, execute scripts in the prescribed order
  Validate successful creation via verification queries
  Proceed to Phase 5: Implementation
