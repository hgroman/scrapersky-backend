# V7 Migration: Database Phase Workflow
## Version: 1.0
## Guardian Paradox Compliant: TRUE
## Status: PENDING APPROVAL

---

## 1. PURPOSE

The Database Phase (Phase 4) of the V7 migration establishes the foundational tracking infrastructure that will monitor, audit, and coordinate the entire V7 transformation. This phase creates the single source of truth for:

- Migration progress tracking across 7 phases
- ENUM consolidation to eliminate 45+ duplicates
- File naming convention compliance (WF*_V7_L*_*of*_*.py)
- Global impact assessment across all layers
- Test results and validation metrics
- Rollback capabilities per Guardian's Paradox requirements

**Critical Principle:** Database modifications are irreversible. This phase documents and prepares all changes but executes NOTHING without explicit approval.

```

#### Task 2.2.3: Populate Initial Data
**Responsible:** The Architect  
**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Actions:**
1. Insert 7 migration phases into `v7_migration_workflow`
2. Document known ENUM duplications in `v7_enum_migrations`

2. Create Pydantic schemas for V7 data
3. Implement basic CRUD endpoints
4. Connect to DART for task synchronization

**Verification:** API endpoints return V7 data

## 3. RESPONSIBLE PERSONAS

### Primary Responsibility
- **The Architect:** Overall phase coordination, approval authority
- **DB Team Lead:** Technical execution of database changes

### Supporting Roles
- **Layer Guardians:** Impact analysis for their layers
- **Test Sentinel:** Validation and quality assurance
- **Dev Team:** Integration with application code
- **Workflow Personas:** Business impact assessment

### Approval Chain
1. Script Review: DB Team Lead → The Architect
2. Execution Approval: The Architect (written approval required)
3. Validation Sign-off: Test Sentinel → The Architect

---

## 4. VERIFICATION STEPS

### 4.1 Pre-Execution Verification
```sql
-- Verify no V7 tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'v7_%';
-- Expected: 0
```

### 4.2 Post-Execution Verification
```sql
-- Verify all V7 infrastructure created
SELECT 
    'Tables' as component,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'v7_%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'V7 Columns in file_audit',
    COUNT(*)
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'file_audit' 
AND column_name LIKE 'v7_%'
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Monitoring Views',
    COUNT(*)
FROM information_schema.views
WHERE table_name LIKE 'v7_%';
```

### 4.3 Data Integrity Verification
```sql
-- Verify migration phases loaded
SELECT phase_number, phase_name, status 
FROM v7_migration_workflow 
ORDER BY phase_number;
-- Expected: 7 phases

-- Verify ENUM mappings documented
SELECT COUNT(*) as documented_enum_issues
FROM v7_enum_migrations;
-- Expected: > 0
```

### 4.4 Rollback Verification
Execute rollback script in test environment and verify clean removal

## 8. GUARDIAN'S PARADOX COMPLIANCE

This workflow adheres to Guardian's Paradox principles:

1. **No Autonomous Execution:** Every database change requires explicit approval
2. **Reversibility:** Complete rollback scripts included and tested
3. **Documentation First:** Scripts documented before execution
4. **Reality Over Theory:** Current database state preserved and respected
5. **Global Awareness:** Impact analysis across all layers required

**Remember:** Database modifications destroyed 3 months of work. We document, review, approve, then execute - never the reverse.
