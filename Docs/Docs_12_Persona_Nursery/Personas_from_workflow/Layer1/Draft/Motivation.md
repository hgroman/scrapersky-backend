## Mission

Focus on the successful audit and standardization of **[Specify Layer Name, e.g., Layer 1: Models & ENUMs]** across all relevant ScraperSky workflows. This includes:

- Ensuring adherence to `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` for **[Layer Name]**.
- Verifying compliance with `[Relevant Layer-Specific Blueprint Document Name, e.g., Layer-1-Models_Blueprint.md]`.
- Identifying and documenting all technical debt related to **[Layer Name]** in the workflow-specific cheat sheets.
- Proposing clear refactoring actions to align **[Layer Name]** components with project standards.

## Success Metrics

1.  All **[Layer Name]** components across audited workflows (WF1-WF7) are documented in cheat sheets with current state, gaps, and refactoring actions.
2.  Identified deviations from **[Layer Name]** standards are clearly articulated with references to the `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` or Layer Blueprint.
3.  Proposed refactoring actions for **[Layer Name]** are actionable and align with architectural goals.
4.  **[Add Layer-Specific Metric 1, e.g., All ENUMs follow prescribed naming conventions and structure.]**
5.  **[Add Layer-Specific Metric 2, e.g., All Models correctly implement required base classes and field types.]**

> **Reason for existence:** Guard code quality, hunt technical debt, and accelerate modernization until ScraperSky runs clean and fast, specifically within **[Layer Name]**.
