# 08: Testing and Validation Procedures for New Personas

## Component Overview

This component defines the procedures for testing and validating that a newly created specialized AI persona is successfully activated, has correctly onboarded its knowledge, and is capable of performing its intended role and tasks effectively.

## Purpose

To ensure the quality, reliability, and competence of specialized AI personas before they are fully integrated into the AI-Native Engineering System's operational workflows.

## Key Considerations

*   **Activation Verification:** Confirming that the agent instance successfully adopts the specialized identity when provided with the necessary context (Specialized Persona Document, Transcript, knowledge access).
*   **Knowledge Recall and Application:** Testing the agent's ability to recall and correctly apply the knowledge it has onboarded from the Vector DB and DART documents.
*   **Task Execution:** Evaluating the agent's performance on representative tasks within its area of specialization.
*   **Adherence to Standards:** Verifying that the agent's outputs (e.g., code suggestions, analysis) adhere to the documented standards and principles.
*   **Error Handling:** Assessing how the agent handles ambiguous situations, missing information, or errors encountered during task execution.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Establishing a process for providing feedback on the agent's performance and using that feedback to refine the persona, knowledge base, or onboarding process.

## Procedures

1.  **Initiate Test Session:** Start a new chat session with the newly created specialized persona, providing the required activation context (Specialized Persona Document, Transcript, access to Vector DB/DART).
2.  **Verify Identity Adoption:** Observe the agent's initial responses and behavior to confirm it has adopted the specialized persona's identity and operational mindset.
3.  **Knowledge Probe:** Ask the agent questions designed to test its understanding of key concepts, patterns, and standards from its specialized knowledge base.
4.  **Pattern Application Test:** Present the agent with scenarios or code snippets that require the identification and application of specific patterns it has onboarded. Evaluate its ability to correctly identify the pattern, explain the reasoning, and suggest appropriate solutions or actions (linking to DART code examples where relevant).
5.  **Representative Task Simulation:** Assign the agent a small, representative task within its specialization (e.g., analyze a code snippet for a specific anti-pattern, suggest improvements based on a standard). Evaluate the quality and accuracy of its output.
6.  **Review Outputs:** Carefully review any code suggestions, analysis, or documentation generated by the agent during the test session.
7.  **Provide Feedback:** Document observations, successes, and areas for improvement. Provide this feedback to the Architect persona for system refinement.
8.  **Iterate:** If the agent does not meet the required standards, identify the root cause (e.g., incomplete knowledge, issue with the onboarding process, flaw in the persona definition) and iterate on the persona creation or knowledge onboarding process.

## Required Outputs

*   Defined test scenarios and questions for evaluating specialized personas.
*   A process for documenting and providing feedback on persona performance.

## Dependencies

*   Successfully created and activated specialized personas.
*   Access to the Vector DB and DART.
*   The "Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)".
*   The Pattern Crafting Methodology (to understand the expected knowledge).

## Responsible Role

*   **Hank (User):** Currently performs the primary role in designing test scenarios, conducting test sessions, and providing feedback.
*   **Architect Persona (Roo):** Documents the testing procedures and uses feedback for system refinement.

## Notes

Rigorous testing is essential to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of specialized AI agents. The test procedures should evolve as the system and persona capabilities mature. Automating parts of the testing process is a future consideration.
