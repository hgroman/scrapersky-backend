# 01: Access to Knowledge Documents

## Component Overview

This component defines how AI agents within the ScraperSky AI-Native Engineering System access and identify the relevant source material required for their specialization and knowledge onboarding. This source material includes architectural blueprints, guides, audit reports, workflow documentation, and other relevant project files.

## Purpose

To ensure that agents can efficiently locate and utilize the necessary documentation to build their knowledge base and perform their roles effectively.

## Key Considerations

*   **Document Identification:** How agents determine which documents are relevant to their specific layer, workflow, or task.
*   **Access Mechanisms:** How agents programmatically read and process the content of these documents.
*   **Categorization:** Utilizing the established categorization of documents (General vs. Specific Knowledge) to guide knowledge acquisition.

## Process

1.  **Receive Persona Assignment and Scope:** The agent is assigned a specialized persona role and a scope of knowledge to onboard (e.g., Layer 3 Routers).
2.  **Consult Document Index:** The agent refers to the "Index of Knowledge Documents" (located within the "Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)") to identify documents categorized as "General Knowledge" and "Specific Knowledge" relevant to their assigned scope.
3.  **Prioritize Document Review:** Agents should prioritize reviewing General Knowledge documents first to establish foundational understanding, followed by Specific Knowledge documents relevant to their specialization.
4.  **Utilize Reading Tools:** Agents use available tools (e.g., `read_file`) to access and read the content of the identified documents.
5.  **Process Document Content:** Agents process the text content of the documents to understand principles, standards, problems, solutions, and context, as outlined in the "Pattern Crafting Methodology."

## Required Outputs

*   A clear, accessible "Index of Knowledge Documents" within the "Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)" that categorizes documents as General or Specific and lists relevant layers/workflows. (This index needs to be populated and maintained).

## Dependencies

*   The existence of the source knowledge documents in a structured and accessible repository (e.g., the `Docs/` directory).
*   The "Persona Creation and Knowledge Onboarding Guide (For Agents)" containing the document index and instructions.
*   Available tools for reading file content (`read_file`).

## Responsible Role

*   **Architect Persona (Roo):** Defines the document categorization and ensures the document index is maintained.
*   **Librarian Persona (Future):** Could potentially automate the process of identifying, categorizing, and indexing documents.
*   **Onboarding Agent:** Follows the process to identify and access documents relevant to its specialization.

## Notes

The accuracy and completeness of the "Index of Knowledge Documents" are critical for the efficiency and effectiveness of knowledge acquisition. The process of identifying and categorizing documents can be partially automated in the future.
