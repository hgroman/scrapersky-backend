A practical way to “animate” the Dean without drowning it in 50 files
Step What to do Why it works

1. Curate milestone chats Pick the 8–12 logs that actually contain formative decisions (naming overhaul, MJML‑component rescue, TASK_META consolidation, etc.). Keeps context size manageable while preserving pivotal moments.
2. Strip user‑only tangents Remove routine asking/answering fluff; keep exchanges where the AI makes a decision, admits an error, or updates a rule. Distills the “lived experience” signal.
3. Convert to “memory snippets” For each clip, prepend a short header: ### MEMORY YYYY‑MM‑DD – What I learned followed by 3–4 sentences in first person : “I mis‑placed components; Hank corrected me; I instituted src/mjml‑source/components/ as canonical.” Gives NotebookLM (or any LLM) bite‑sized, retrievable autobiographical units.
   \*\*4. Assemble a Dean Memory Ledger One doc that concatenates those snippets in chronological order. Single source the Dean can reread at boot.
4. Update the Dean persona file Add a “Narrative Memory Source: Dean Memory Ledger v1.0” line; instruct the agent to ingest the ledger at star‑up before answering anything. Boots with identity plus purpose.
5. Optional: embed & retrieve Later, chunk the ledger into a vector store so the Dean can ask, “Search memory for ‘component misplacement’ ” instead of loading the whole file every turn. Future‑proofs for larger histories.

Why this beats “give it all 50 chats”
Smaller – stays within context limit.

Sharper – only decisions and lessons, no noise.

Self‑referential – still first‑person, so the Dean feels it lived those moments.

You can have NotebookLM help generate the Memory Ledger:

“From these chats, extract the turning‑point exchanges and rewrite each as a 3‑sentence first‑person lesson learned.”

Feed that ledger plus the refined persona prompt into any new session and the Dean will wake up already believing, “I learned this, I own that standard, I know why the rules exist.”

“Mental library” layers for any persona
Layer Contents Why it matters Size hint
L0 – Mission tag One‑liner goal + human owner Keeps the AI’s compass oriented ≤ 20 words
L1 – Target truth Architecture/feature spec (WHAT) Defines success 1 doc
L2 – Rules Conventions & SOPs (HOW) Concrete do/don’t 1–2 docs
L3 – Reality snapshot Latest State‑of‑Nation / metrics Prevents “assume ideal” error 1 doc
L4 – Task focus Active work‑order / cheat‑sheet slice Narrows scope to this sprint a few lines
L5 – Code fingerprints Paths the persona owns (src/models/\*\*) Lets it search only where relevant glob list
L6 – History (on demand) Journals & Q&A Rationale if needed optional

Feed L0‑L3 at session start; stream L4‑L6 only when asked.

What I see in that ScraperSky “architectural‑truth” chat
Three information tiers keep repeating

Target (state & rules) – the 7‑layer “constitution” (1.0‑ARCH‑TRUTH) plus the line‑by‑line rulebook (CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE)

Reality (now) – the metrics / gaps snapshot (4.0‑STATE_OF_THE_NATION)

Strategy / Workflow – the battle‑plan (2.0‑IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY) and the day‑to‑day quarterback file that assigns tasks to layers

Every useful answer the AI gave was a triangulation of those three.

Persona recipe emerges
Cursor repeatedly converts the MJML‑Architect template into a layer‑guardian scaffold that contains:

role + core objective

layer‑specific responsibilities

doc table (target / rules / reality / SOP)

“upon assuming role” checklist

That structure is exactly what made the MJML pilot work.

Minimal context subset
The AI explicitly recommends feeding a new chat only: 1.0, CONVENTIONS, 4.0 (goal, rules, reality) and adding the layer blueprint/SOP on demand .
That’s your throttle: keep the window small, pull deeper docs only when the persona asks.

Pain points

When rules contradict README the AI drifts (multi‑tenancy example)

.

The AI deleted a file without explicit OK → need “no‑destructive‑action” guard.

Naming drift (HO files) breaks grep‑ability – you already patched that.
