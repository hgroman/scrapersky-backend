# ScraperSky SQLAlchemy Migration: Checkpoint Document

## Issues Fixed and Current Status

### 1. Fixed Core Service Implementation Issues

We've addressed several critical issues in the transition to SQLAlchemy:

1. **JobService Implementation**:

   - Implemented missing methods flagged by linter errors:
     - `create_job`
     - `start_job`
     - `get_job_status`
     - `update_job_status`
     - `complete_job`
     - `fail_job`
     - `save_job_to_database`
   - Created hybrid implementation that maintains both in-memory tracking (for backward compatibility) and SQLAlchemy persistence
   - Added proper logging and error handling

2. **DBService Implementation**:

   - Created a transitional DBService using SQLAlchemy's text() function
   - Implemented all required methods referenced in the scraper:
     - `fetch_all`
     - `fetch_one`
     - `execute`
     - `execute_returning`
     - `execute_transaction`
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - This bridge service allows gradual transition from raw SQL to ORM

3. **Parameter Mismatch Fixes**:

   - Fixed mismatched parameters in the `process_domain_scan` function call
   - Updated the function call to correctly pass `user_id` instead of `current_user`

4. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Added proper import for the db_service in sitemap_scraper.py

### 2. Current Assessment

The codebase is in a transition state between raw SQL and SQLAlchemy ORM:

1. **Core Infrastructure**:

   - SQLAlchemy async engine and connection pooling is properly configured
   - Session management is in place with both async and sync support
   - Initial Alembic migration has been created

2. **Models**:

   - Domain model implemented but possibly missing some fields
   - Job model implemented with linter errors related to setattr operations
   - BatchJob model exists but may need enhancements

3. **Services**:

   - JobService has a hybrid implementation (in-memory + SQLAlchemy)
   - DBService provides a SQLAlchemy-based SQL execution bridge
   - Domain service exists but implementation details unknown

4. **Integration**:

   - Sitemap scraper still using mixed patterns
   - Background tasks need to be updated to use SQLAlchemy transactions
   - Job tracking needs to be fully migrated to use SQLAlchemy

5. **Linter Issues**:
   - Several linter errors remain in JobService:
     - Type compatibility issues between str/UUID
     - Assignment to Job model attributes
     - Conditional checking of SQLAlchemy Column objects
     - Dictionary update method called on Column objects

## Migration Implementation Roadmap

   4. Add unit tests for service methods

### Phase 3: Endpoint-by-Endpoint Migration

1. **sitemap_scraper.py** (Priority)

   1. Migrate scan_domain endpoint (POST /api/v1/scrapersky)
      - Replace direct SQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
      - Use proper transaction management
      - Maintain API compatibility
   2. Migrate batch_scan_domains endpoint (POST /api/v1/batch)
      - Update batch processing to use SQLAlchemy
      - Ensure proper concurrency handling
   3. Migrate status endpoints (GET /api/v1/status/{job_id}, GET /api/v1/batch/status/{batch_id})
      - Replace raw SQL queries with SQLAlchemy queries
   4. Update background processing
      - Use SQLAlchemy transactions
      - Maintain concurrency controls

2. **Other endpoints** (After sitemap is stable)
   - Apply same patterns to remaining endpoints
   - Consistent error handling with SQLAlchemy

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Optimization

1. Remove temporary compatibility layers:

   - Gradually phase out in-memory job tracking
   - Replace DBService with direct ORM queries
   - Eliminate dual-tracking patterns

2. Optimize SQLAlchemy queries:

   - Use relationship joins instead of separate queries
   - Add proper indices to models
   - Implement eager loading for related objects

3. Add comprehensive tests:

   - Unit tests for models and services
   - Integration tests for endpoints
   - Performance tests comparing old and new implementations

4. Update documentation:
   - Create new developer guidelines for SQLAlchemy
   - Document migration patterns for future reference
   - Update API documentation

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix JobService Linter Errors**:

   - Properly convert between UUID and string values
   - Fix attribute assignment issues
   - Handle Column objects correctly

2. **Improve Domain Model**:

   - Ensure all fields required by the sitemap scraper exist
   - Add proper relationship to Job model
   - Add serialization methods

3. **Migrate First Endpoint Function**:

   - Choose a single endpoint function to fully migrate
   - Update to use SQLAlchemy models and session
   - Test thoroughly
   - Use as template for remaining functions

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Create a dedicated testing module for SQLAlchemy components
   - Verify data consistency between old and new implementations
   - Set up automated tests

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. JobService Hybrid Implementation

The JobService now maintains both the legacy in-memory tracking and SQLAlchemy persistence:

```python
def create_job(self, resource_name: str, initial_status: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Create a new job with initial status and return the job ID."""
    # Generate job ID
    job_id = f"{resource_name}_{uuid.uuid4()}"

    # Initialize status dictionary
    status_dict = {
        "id": job_id,
        "status": self.STATUS_PENDING,
        "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        **initial_status
    }

    # Store in memory for backward compatibility
    self._job_statuses[job_id] = status_dict

    logger.info(f"Created job {job_id} with initial status: {status_dict}")

    return job_id
```

### 2. DBService as Migration Bridge

The DBService provides a SQLAlchemy-based implementation of the previous raw SQL functions:

```python
async def fetch_all(
    self,
    query: str,
    params: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Execute a SQL query and return all results as a list of dictionaries."""
    async with async_session() as session:
        try:
            result = await session.execute(text(query), params or {})
            # Convert result to list of dictionaries
            return [dict(row._mapping) for row in result]
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error executing query: {e}")
            logger.error(f"Query: {query}")
            logger.error(f"Params: {params}")
            # Re-raise for proper error handling
            raise
```

### 3. Transaction Management Approach

Proper SQLAlchemy transaction management is critical:

```python
async with async_session() as session:
    async with session.begin():
        # All operations here are part of a single transaction
        # If an exception occurs, the transaction is automatically rolled back
        session.add(domain)
        session.add(job)
        # No need for explicit commit - session.begin() handles it
```

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Dual State Management

**Challenge**: Need to maintain both in-memory and database state during transition.

**Solution**:

- Created hybrid implementations that maintain both in-memory and SQLAlchemy state
- Added database persistence methods to save in-memory state

### 2. Type Compatibility

**Challenge**: Mixing UUID and string types between layers.

**Solution**:

- Added explicit type conversion logic
- Created helper functions to handle UUID conversion

### 3. Transaction Management

**Challenge**: Moving from connection-based to session-based transactions.

**Solution**:

- Using SQLAlchemy's async context managers
- Properly handling commit/rollback in error cases

### 4. API Compatibility

**Challenge**: Maintaining backwards compatibility for clients.

**Solution**:

- Preserving the same response formats
- Handling legacy IDs alongside UUID values

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The SQLAlchemy migration is progressing well, with core infrastructure in place and initial service implementations completed. The hybrid approach allows for gradual migration without breaking existing functionality.

**Key recommendations**:

1. **Continue the incremental approach**: Focus on one endpoint function at a time
2. **Fix JobService linter errors**: Address type compatibility and attribute assignment issues
3. **Develop robust testing**: Create tests to verify functionality equivalence
4. **Document patterns**: Capture successful migration patterns for reuse
5. **Monitor performance**: Compare old and new implementations for performance regression

This checkpoint represents significant progress toward a more maintainable, type-safe, and standardized codebase using SQLAlchemy ORM.
