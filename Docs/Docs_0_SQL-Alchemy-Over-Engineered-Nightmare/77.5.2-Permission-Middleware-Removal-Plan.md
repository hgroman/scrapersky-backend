# Permission Middleware Removal Plan

## Files to Delete:

1. `src/middleware/permission_middleware.py`

   - This is the primary middleware file containing `AuthMiddleware` and `permission_middleware`

2. `tests/middleware/test_permission_middleware.py`
   - All tests specifically for this middleware

## Files to Modify:

### 1. `src/main.py`

Remove these lines (around line 580-587):

```python
# Add permission middleware for RBAC, with explicit logging
from .middleware.permission_middleware import AuthMiddleware
logger.info("Adding Authentication Middleware")
app.add_middleware(AuthMiddleware)

# Log the PUBLIC_PATHS from the middleware for debugging
from .middleware.permission_middleware import PUBLIC_PATHS
logger.info(f"Public paths exempt from authentication: {PUBLIC_PATHS}")
```

### 2. `src/middleware/__init__.py`

Change from:

```python
from .permission_middleware import permission_middleware
from .tenant_middleware import TenantMiddleware

__all__ = ["permission_middleware", "TenantMiddleware"]
```

To:

```python
from .tenant_middleware import TenantMiddleware

__all__ = ["TenantMiddleware"]
```

### 3. `tests/integration/test_rbac_integration.py`

This file contains multiple patches to `src.middleware.permission_middleware.get_session` that will need to be updated:

- Lines: 103, 124, 147, 168, 194, 220, 247, 278, 299, 327
- These tests will need to be rewritten to use the new authentication system

## No Need to Modify (But Note):

1. `src/auth/jwt_auth.py`

   - Contains `decode_token` used by the middleware, but also used by your new auth dependency
   - Keep this file, as your new authentication system will use it

2. `src/middleware/tenant_middleware.py`

   - Independent middleware that handles tenant context for database
   - Keep this as it serves a different purpose

3. `scripts/test_auth_middleware.py`
   - A testing script that can be deleted if no longer needed

## After Removal:

1. Update routes to use your new dependency-based authentication:

   ```python
   from ..auth.dependencies import get_current_user

   @router.get("/endpoint")
   async def endpoint(current_user = Depends(get_current_user)):
       # Use current_user instead of request.state.user
   ```

2. Search your entire codebase for:
   - `request.state.user` - Replace with dependency injection
   - Any imports or references to `permission_middleware`

## Verification Tests:

1. Start the app after removal to check for import errors
2. Test public endpoints to ensure they still work
3. Test authenticated endpoints with your new auth dependency
4. Test tenant-specific data access

## Safety Notes:

- The `TenantMiddleware` in `src/middleware/tenant_middleware.py` is separate and should be kept
- Your codebase will temporarily break until you update routes to use the new authentication
- Consider implementing this in a feature branch before merging to main
