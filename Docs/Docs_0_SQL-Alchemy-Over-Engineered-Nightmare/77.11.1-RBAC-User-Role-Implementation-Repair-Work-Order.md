# 77.11.1 - RBAC User-Role Implementation Repair Work Order

**Date**: March 9, 2025
**Subject**: Fixes for User-Role Assignment Functionality
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

## 1. Overview

Following our successful repair of the `RbacService` role-permissions methods, we now need to address issues in the user-role assignment functionality. The test-rbac-user-role.html page is currently broken because of similar SQLAlchemy ORM usage issues.

## 2. Current Issues

1. **Type Inconsistencies**: Mismatches between router parameter types and service expected types for role_id (str vs int)

2. **Connection Issues**: The user-roles API endpoints in `src/routers/unified_rbac.py` may be experiencing connection pooling issues similar to what we saw with the permissions endpoints.

## 3. Repair Tasks

### 3.1. Fix Type Inconsistencies in `rbac_service.py`

We've already fixed some type inconsistencies in the `RbacService` implementation for the role-permissions methods. We need to ensure the user-role methods are similarly aligned:

1. Update the type annotations in the following methods:
   - `assign_role_to_user`
   - `remove_role_from_user`
   - `get_user_roles`

2. Ensure the role_id parameter is consistently handled as an integer in these methods to match the database schema and router expectations.

### 3.2. Check Connection Pooling Configuration

Investigate if there are connection pooling issues with the user-role endpoints similar to what the test page notes about the profiles endpoint:

```javascript
/**
 * IMPORTANT: The profiles endpoint requires special parameters to avoid prepared statement errors.
 * This is because our system uses Supavisor for connection pooling, and prepared statements
 * can cause issues with certain endpoints. We try multiple approaches:
 * 1. raw_sql=true - Tells the backend to use raw SQL instead of ORM
 * 2. no_prepare=true - Disables prepared statements
 * 3. statement_cache_size=0 - Sets the asyncpg statement cache size to 0
 */
```

We should verify if a similar approach is needed for the RBAC endpoints.

## 4. Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**: Create/modify unit tests for the RbacService user-role methods.

2. **Integration Tests**: Test the API endpoints that use these methods:
   - `GET /api/v3/rbac/users/{user_id}/roles`
   - `POST /api/v3/rbac/users/{user_id}/roles`
   - `DELETE /api/v3/rbac/users/{user_id}/roles/{role_id}`
   - `GET /api/v3/rbac/user-roles`

3. **UI Testing**: Verify the test-rbac-user-role.html page functions correctly:
   - Can view user-role assignments
   - Can assign new roles to users
   - Can remove roles from users

## 5. Implementation Notes

This repair should follow the same pattern we used for the role-permissions fixes, focusing on proper SQLAlchemy ORM usage and consistent type handling.
