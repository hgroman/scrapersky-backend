# Efficient Process for Reverse Engineering an API Endpoint

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the reverse engineering process, ensure you have:

1. **Access to the running application** - The API should be running and accessible
2. **Authentication credentials** - API token, username/password, or other authentication mechanism
3. **Basic API testing tools** - curl, Postman, or similar tools for making requests
4. **Access to the codebase** - To trace the implementation from routing to database
5. **Database access** - To examine the underlying data structure

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Examine the Database Schema

- Identify relevant tables and their relationships
- Note primary keys, foreign keys, and important fields
- Document data types and constraints
- Check for tenant isolation patterns (tenant_id fields)

### 2. Locate Endpoint Implementation in Code

- Search for router definitions related to the endpoint
- **Check for duplicate router files implementing the same functionality**
- **Verify router is actually registered in the application (e.g., in main.py)**
- Identify HTTP methods supported (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Note any authentication/authorization requirements
- Document path parameters and query parameters

### 3. Examine Service Layer Implementation

- Trace from the router to service methods
- Identify database operations and business logic
- **Verify response model type matches service return type**
- Note any data transformations or validations

### 4. Test the Endpoint with Required Parameters

- **Begin testing with verbose output to catch validation errors**
  ```bash
  curl -v "http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint" -H "Authorization: Bearer token"
  ```
- Test each HTTP method with appropriate parameters
- Document required headers, query parameters, and request bodies
- Note any special requirements (e.g., prepared statements workarounds)
- Test with different inputs to understand validation rules

### 5. Document in Standard Format

- Use consistent documentation format (YAML, Markdown, etc.)
- Include endpoint path, methods, parameters, and authentication requirements
- Document request and response examples
- Note any special considerations or warnings
- **Include response model information and verify it matches actual responses**

## Critical System Requirements

The following patterns and requirements should be documented for each endpoint:

1. **Authentication Headers**

   - Most endpoints require:
     - `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
     - `X-Tenant-ID: {tenant_id}`

2. **Query Parameters for Database Access**

   - Common parameters to avoid prepared statement issues:
     - `raw_sql=true`
     - `no_prepare=true`
     - `statement_cache_size=0`

3. **Response Format Patterns**

   - Most endpoints follow:
     ```json
     {
       "data": [...],
       "metadata": {} // Optional
     }
     ```

4. **Tenant Isolation Patterns**

   - Some resources are tenant-specific (filtered by tenant_id)
   - Some resources are global (shared across all tenants)

5. **Common Points of Failure**
   - **Response model type mismatches** - Route declares one type but service returns another
   - **Duplicate router implementations** - Multiple files implementing same routes
   - **Routers not properly registered** - Router exists but isn't mounted in the application

## Example: Roles Endpoint Documentation

### Endpoint Information

**Name:** Roles
**Base Path:** `/api/v3/rbac/roles`
**Database Table:** `roles`
**Authentication Required:** Yes
**Tenant Isolation:** Yes
**Router File:** `src/routers/unified_rbac.py`
**Response Model:** `List[Dict[str, Any]]`

### Database Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES tenants(id)
);
```

### Supported Methods

- **GET /** - List all roles

  - Required Params: `tenant_id` (header)
  - Response: List of role objects
  - Service Method: `rbac_service.get_all_roles()`
  - Return Type: `List[Dict]`

- **POST /** - Create new role

  - Required Body: `{ name, description }`
  - Response: Created role object
  - Service Method: `rbac_service.create_role()`
  - Return Type: `Dict`

- **GET /{id}** - Get specific role

  - Path Params: `id`
  - Response: Role object
  - Service Method: `rbac_service.get_role()`
  - Return Type: `Dict`

- **PUT /{id}** - Update role

  - Path Params: `id`
  - Required Body: `{ name, description }`
  - Response: Updated role object
  - Service Method: `rbac_service.update_role()`
  - Return Type: `Dict`

- **DELETE /{id}** - Delete role
  - Path Params: `id`
  - Response: Success message
  - Service Method: `rbac_service.delete_role()`
  - Return Type: `Dict`

### Testing Commands

```bash
# First test with verbose output to catch validation errors
curl -v "http://localhost:8000/api/v3/rbac/roles" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

# Then test with query parameters
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v3/rbac/roles?raw_sql=true&no_prepare=true&statement_cache_size=0" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" \
  -H "X-Tenant-ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "USER",
      "description": "Basic user with limited permissions",
      "tenant_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "created_at": "2025-03-04T06:24:00.862958+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Notes

- Roles are tenant-specific, requiring X-Tenant-ID header
- All database operations require the three query parameters to avoid prepared statement issues
- Default system roles include USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN, and GLOBAL_ADMIN
- Response model and service return type match correctly

## Handling Missing or Problematic Endpoints

When an endpoint exists in documentation but is not functioning properly:

1. **Check Router Files**

   - Search for all possible router files that might implement the endpoint
   - **Look for duplicate router implementations**
   - **Confirm which routers are actually registered in the application**

2. **Verify Endpoint Path**

   - Try variations of the path: with/without trailing slash, different prefixes, etc.
   - Check case sensitivity (though most paths should be lowercase)

3. **Examine Error Responses**

   - Use verbose curl output to get detailed error information
   - Common issues:
     - 404: Endpoint not found or not registered
     - 405: Method not allowed
     - 422: Validation error
     - **500: Server error (often due to response model mismatch)**

4. **Trace Through Code**

   - Examine service implementation to understand the expected input/output
   - **Verify response model matches service return type**
   - Check for inconsistencies between router declaration and implementation

5. **Check Database Schema**
   - Verify table structure matches the expected data model
   - Check for constraints that might cause operations to fail

## Case Study: Tenant Features Endpoint Investigation

Our recent investigation of the tenant features endpoint revealed several key lessons:

1. **Response Model Mismatch**

   - The endpoint was correctly defined in `rbac_features.py` but had the wrong response model type
   - Route declared `response_model=List[Dict[str, Any]]`
   - Service actually returned `Dict[str, bool]`
   - This caused validation errors and 500 Internal Server Errors

2. **Duplicate Router Files**

   - Both `rbac_features.py` and `feature.py` had similar functionality
   - Only `rbac_features.py` was actually registered in the application
   - This caused confusion when trying to locate the correct implementation

3. **Router Registration**

   - Despite being defined, some routers were not registered in `main.py`
   - Always verify both the router file exists AND is mounted in the application

4. **Verbose Error Analysis**
   - Using `curl -v` revealed the validation error details that were crucial for debugging
   - The error showed that a dict was returned when a list was expected

## Best Practices for Endpoint Documentation and Testing

1. **Consistent Documentation Format**

   - Use a standard format (YAML, Markdown) for all endpoints
   - Include router file location, response model, and service return type

2. **Progressive Testing**

   - Start with verbose testing: `curl -v [endpoint]`
   - Then add query parameters once basic operation is verified
   - Test each HTTP method with appropriate parameters

3. **Response Model Verification**

   - Always document both the declared response model and actual return type
   - Highlight any discrepancies as warning flags

4. **Router Registration Checks**

   - Document where and how each router is registered in the application
   - Verify registration when endpoints can't be accessed

5. **Cross-Reference Implementation**
   - Link endpoint documentation to actual code implementations
   - Update documentation when code changes

By following this process, you'll be able to efficiently reverse engineer API endpoints, detect common issues, and create comprehensive documentation that helps both developers and users understand the API's capabilities and requirements.
