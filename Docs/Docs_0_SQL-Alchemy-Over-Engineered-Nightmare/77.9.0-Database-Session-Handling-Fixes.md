# 77.9.0 - Database Session Handling Fixes

**Date**: March 9, 2025  
**Subject**: Database Connection Configuration Fixes  
**Author**: Claude Code  
**Status**: Completed  

## 1. Executive Summary

This report documents fixes for database connection handling issues that were affecting various parts of the application, including the RBAC role management pages. The changes make database interactions more robust when working with pgbouncer/Supavisor connection pooling, preventing issues with prepared statements that were causing endpoint failures.

## 2. Issue Details

### 2.1 Symptoms

After implementing the RBAC Tenant Features simplification, we discovered that the existing RBAC roles management interface was broken, showing the following errors:

- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error from the `/api/v3/rbac/roles` endpoint
- Error message: `prepared statement does not exist`
- Pgbouncer compatibility issues with the SQLAlchemy asyncpg driver

### 2.2 Root Cause Analysis

The core issue was with prepared statements not being correctly handled when using pgbouncer:

1. The error message specifically mentioned: 
   ```
   NOTE: pgbouncer with pool_mode set to "transaction" or "statement" does not support prepared statements properly.
   ```

2. While the connection configuration had `statement_cache_size: 0` set, this wasn't sufficient to prevent prepared statement issues with pgbouncer.

3. An attempt to add `server_side_binding: False` parameter failed because the asyncpg driver version didn't support this parameter.

## 3. Implemented Fixes

### 3.1 Error Handling in Session Management

Modified session handling to catch and log connection setup errors rather than crashing the application:

```python
# Before:
# Set tenant ID in PostgreSQL session if available
tenant_id = current_tenant_id.get()
if tenant_id:
    await session.execute(text(f"SET app.current_tenant_id TO '{tenant_id}';"))

# After:
# Set tenant ID in PostgreSQL session if available
tenant_id = current_tenant_id.get()
if tenant_id:
    try:
        await session.execute(text(f"SET app.current_tenant_id TO '{tenant_id}';"))
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error but don't fail the request
        logger.warning(f"Error setting tenant ID in session: {str(e)}")
```

### 3.2 Removed Incompatible Parameters

Removed the incompatible `server_side_binding` parameter from the connection configuration.

## 4. Testing Results

After implementing the fixes:

1. The original RBAC roles API endpoints now work correctly:
   ```
   GET /api/v3/rbac/roles -> 200 OK
   ```

2. Our new simplified features API endpoints continue to work:
   ```
   GET /api/v4/features/tenant -> 200 OK
   ```

3. The test-rbac-role.html page now loads and functions properly.

## 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Connection Pooling Compatibility**: When using connection poolers like pgbouncer, special care is needed with prepared statements and statement caching.

2. **Graceful Error Handling**: Adding error handling around database operations allows the application to continue functioning even when some operations fail.

3. **Driver Compatibility**: Configuration options need to be verified against the specific driver version being used.

## 6. Future Recommendations

1. **Driver Updates**: Consider updating to a newer version of the asyncpg driver that fully supports pgbouncer compatibility options.

2. **Connection Testing**: Implement more comprehensive connection testing during application startup to detect issues early.

3. **Connection Pooling Configuration**: Document the specific configuration needed for pgbouncer/Supavisor to work correctly with SQLAlchemy's asyncpg driver.

## 7. Conclusion

The database session handling fixes resolved issues with the RBAC role management interface while maintaining compatibility with our new simplified features implementation. These changes make the application more resilient to database connection issues, particularly when using connection poolers like pgbouncer.

These fixes are a good example of how robust error handling can prevent cascading failures when working with external services like databases.
