# Database Driver Modernization Recommendations

## Current State

The ScraperSky backend currently uses a mix of database drivers:

- **asyncpg** (v0.30.0): Used for all async SQLAlchemy operations
- **psycopg2-binary** (v2.9.6): Used for synchronous operations, migrations, and diagnostics
- **psycopg** (v3.2.5): Newer PostgreSQL adapter, partially integrated

## Recommendations

### Short-Term Improvements

1. **Clarify Driver Usage**

   - Add comments in `requirements.txt` explaining why each driver is needed
   - Document in README which driver is used for which purpose

2. **Optimize Docker Build**

   - Move `psycopg2-binary` to a separate requirements file for development/CI only
   - Use multi-stage Docker builds to separate migration tools from the main application

3. **Address Port Conflict**
   - Implement a port availability check in `run_server.py` to handle the "Address already in use" error
   - Add a graceful shutdown mechanism for existing processes

### Medium-Term Modernization

1. **Migrate Synchronous Operations to psycopg v3**

   - Update `sync_connection_string` in `DatabaseConfig` to use psycopg v3
   - Modify Alembic configuration to use psycopg v3
   - Update diagnostic scripts like `test_connection.py`

2. **Standardize Connection Management**

   - Consolidate duplicate session management code between `src/db/session.py` and `src/session/async_session.py`
   - Create a unified connection factory that handles both sync and async needs

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more robust connection retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Implement connection pooling monitoring and health checks

### Long-Term Vision

1. **Full Async Migration**

   - Research and implement async Alembic migrations
   - Remove all synchronous database operations where possible
   - Consider dropping psycopg2 entirely once all sync operations are migrated

2. **Connection Optimization**

   - Implement connection pooling metrics and monitoring
   - Add adaptive pool sizing based on application load
   - Consider implementing a connection proxy for better debugging

3. **Dependency Reduction**
   - Evaluate if both psycopg v3 and asyncpg are needed long-term
   - Consider standardizing on a single driver technology with both sync/async capabilities

## Implementation Priority

1. Short-term improvements (1-2 weeks)
2. Medium-term modernization (1-2 months)
3. Long-term vision (3-6 months)

## Next Steps

1. Create tickets for each recommendation
2. Prioritize based on current pain points
3. Implement changes incrementally with proper testing
4. Document all changes in the project architecture documentation
