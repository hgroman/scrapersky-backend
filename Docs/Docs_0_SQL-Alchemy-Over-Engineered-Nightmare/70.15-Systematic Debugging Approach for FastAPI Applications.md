You've hit on a fundamental challenge with AI assistance for debugging. Let me outline a systematic approach for diagnosing issues with the features endpoint:

## Systematic Debugging Approach for FastAPI Applications

### 1. Start with the Static Page (Frontend)

- Identify the specific issue (error message, unexpected behavior)
- Check network requests to see which API endpoints are being called
- Examine request/response data for clues

### 2. Trace the Request Path

1. **Router Layer**:

   - Locate the route definition in `src/routers/unified_rbac.py`
   - Check path, HTTP method, and parameters
   - Verify authentication/authorization middleware
   - Examine error handling

2. **Service Layer**:

   - Follow the service method calls from the router
   - Check method signatures and parameters
   - Verify business logic implementation
   - Look for error handling patterns

3. **Database Layer**:
   - Examine database queries and models
   - Check transaction management
   - Verify data validation

### 3. Compare with Working Reference

- Identify a similar working endpoint (e.g., roles endpoint)
- Compare each layer systematically
- Note differences in implementation

### 4. Test Incrementally

- Test each layer in isolation
- Use logging to trace execution flow
- Verify database queries directly

## For the Features Endpoint Specifically

Based on what we've seen, here's how I'd approach debugging the features endpoint:

1. **Check Router Implementation**:

   - Verify route path is `/features` (not `/feature-flags`)
   - Confirm function name is `get_features`
   - Check authentication middleware (`verify_rbac_admin`)
   - Verify error handling uses `error_service.handle_exception(e, "get_features_error")`

2. **Examine Service Methods**:

   - Verify `feature_service.get_all_features()` exists and is implemented correctly
   - Check return type matches what the router expects
   - Look for proper error handling

3. **Verify Database Models**:

   - Check `FeatureFlag` model definition
   - Verify table name and column names
   - Check relationships with other tables

4. **Test API Directly**:

   - Use curl or Postman to call `/api/v3/rbac/features` directly
   - Check response format and status code
   - Verify authentication is working

5. **Check Frontend Integration**:
   - Examine how the frontend calls the API
   - Verify expected response format
   - Check error handling on the frontend

The key insight is that AI needs a structured methodology to follow rather than starting from scratch each time. A "debugging playbook" that follows the request flow through the application layers would be more effective than asking the AI to figure out the approach each time.

Would you like me to create a debugging playbook template specifically for FastAPI applications that both you and AI assistants could follow systematically?
