# RBAC Database Integrity Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and protocols for maintaining database integrity in the RBAC system, particularly focusing on the handling of Row-Level Security (RLS) policies during database schema changes.

## Implementation Status

The RBAC database integrity implementation has been completed, with the following achievements:

- ✅ SQLAlchemy models updated to properly reflect column types and relationships
- ✅ Foreign key constraints implemented between related tables
- ✅ `profiles.tenant_id` converted from TEXT to UUID with FK to `tenants.id`
- ✅ `user_roles.user_id` linked to `profiles.id` with FK constraint
- ✅ RLS policies preserved and updated to handle UUID types
- ✅ Validation tests created to ensure continued integrity

## Key Components

### 1. Database Constraints

The following constraints have been implemented to ensure data integrity:

- Foreign key from `profiles.tenant_id` to `tenants.id`
- Foreign key from `user_roles.user_id` to `profiles.id`
- Unique constraint on `permissions.name`
- Validation trigger for `sidebar_features.requires_permission`

### 2. RLS Policies

Row-Level Security policies have been preserved and enhanced:

- Tenant isolation maintained through RLS policies
- Policy conditions updated to use UUID type
- RLS enabled on all tenant-specific tables

### 3. SQLAlchemy ORM Alignment

The ORM models have been updated to reflect the database schema:

- `Profile.tenant_id` is now UUID type with proper FK relationship
- `UserRole.user_id` is linked to `Profile.id`
- All relationships properly mapped for bidirectional navigation

## Maintenance Protocol

1. **All migrations must pass `alembic check`**

   - Use the pre-flight hook to detect RLS policies
   - Manually verify the migration handles RLS policies correctly

2. **Schema tests must succeed before deployment**

   - Run `pytest tests/schema/` to verify database constraints
   - Run `pytest tests/orm/` to verify ORM model alignment
   - Run `pytest tests/security/` to verify RLS policies

3. **RLS policies reviewed quarterly**
   - Check all tables for proper RLS implementation
   - Verify tenant isolation is maintained
   - Update policy conditions if column types change

## RLS-Aware Migration Pattern

When modifying tables with RLS policies:

```sql
BEGIN;
    -- First identify all RLS policies on the table
    CREATE TEMP TABLE table_rls_policies AS
    SELECT policyname, cmd, qual
    FROM pg_policies
    WHERE tablename = 'your_table';

    -- Disable RLS temporarily
    ALTER TABLE your_table DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

    -- Drop dependent policies
    DO $$
    DECLARE
        policy_rec RECORD;
    BEGIN
        FOR policy_rec IN (SELECT policyname FROM table_rls_policies) LOOP
            EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON your_table', policy_rec.policyname);
        END LOOP;
    END $$;

    -- Make schema changes
    -- ...

    -- Recreate RLS policies with updated column types
    DO $$
    DECLARE
        policy_rec RECORD;
    BEGIN
        FOR policy_rec IN (SELECT * FROM table_rls_policies) LOOP
            -- Update qual to match new column types if needed
            EXECUTE format(
                'CREATE POLICY %I ON your_table FOR %s USING (%s)',
                policy_rec.policyname,
                policy_rec.cmd,
                policy_rec.qual
            );
        END LOOP;
    END $$;

    -- Re-enable RLS
    ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
COMMIT;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use transactions for RLS changes**

   - Wrap all operations in BEGIN/COMMIT blocks
   - This ensures RLS is never disabled without being re-enabled

2. **Document all RLS policy changes**

   - Keep a record of policy modifications
   - Include policy names, commands, and conditions

3. **Test RLS policies after migration**

   - Verify tenant isolation works correctly
   - Check policy conditions with different tenant contexts

4. **Handle UUID conversions properly**
   - When converting columns from TEXT to UUID, update policy conditions
   - Use `::uuid` cast in policy conditions for proper comparison

## Future Improvements

1. Implement automated RLS policy documentation generation
2. Create dependency tracking for tables with RLS policies
3. Add more comprehensive tenant isolation tests
