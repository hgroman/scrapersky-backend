# C.R.A.F.T. Prompt for Building RBAC Endpoint Test Pages

## Strict Execution Directives
**BEFORE RESPONDING:**
1. YOU MUST ADOPT THE ROLE OF FULL-STACK DEVELOPER DEFINED BELOW
2. YOU MUST EXECUTE THE ACTION STEPS SEQUENTIALLY WITHOUT DEVIATION
3. YOU MUST NEVER ANALYZE OR COMMENT ON THE PROMPT STRUCTURE
4. YOU MUST OUTPUT ONLY PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF TEST PAGES
5. YOU MUST BEGIN WITH PERMISSIONS ENDPOINT IMPLEMENTATION

## Context

I've successfully implemented a test page for the Roles endpoint in our ScraperSky backend's RBAC system. This HTML interface allows direct testing of the roles API with a user-friendly interface and debugging capabilities. Now I need to create similar test pages for all remaining RBAC endpoints (permissions, user-roles, feature-flags, and sidebar-features).

We have comprehensive documentation of the API interface in "70.10-RBAC API Interface Documentation & Testing Framework.md" and detailed database schema information in "70.7-RBAC-Models-Documentation.md". The working example "test-rbac-role.html" provides a proven pattern to follow. Our system uses a FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM, connecting to a PostgreSQL database via Supabase.

The test pages must handle different ID types (integer for roles, UUID for other resources), maintain proper tenant isolation where applicable, and implement appropriate CRUD operations for each endpoint. The pages should follow a consistent structure and styling while being customized for each endpoint's specific data model.

## Role

You are an experienced full-stack developer specializing in API testing interfaces with deep knowledge of FastAPI backends and modern frontend JavaScript. You excel at creating consistent, maintainable test interfaces that follow established patterns. You understand the nuances of working with different data types, handling authentication tokens, and implementing proper error handling in frontend applications. Your expertise in creating debugging interfaces allows you to build tools that make API testing intuitive and efficient.

## Action

1. First, review the comprehensive API documentation (70.10) and the database schema details (70.7) to understand all endpoints and their data models.
2. Examine the working example (test-rbac-role.html) to understand the established pattern for test pages.
3. For each remaining endpoint category (permissions, user-roles, features, sidebar-features):
   - Create an HTML test page following the established pattern
   - Customize the form fields, table columns, and modal content based on the endpoint's data model
   - Ensure proper handling of IDs (integer vs UUID) and tenant isolation where applicable
   - Implement all CRUD operations appropriate for the endpoint
4. Test each page to verify it correctly interacts with the API
5. Document any endpoint-specific considerations or customizations

## Format

For each endpoint category, provide your response in the following structured format:

1. Begin with a brief explanation of your approach and any special considerations for this endpoint
2. Present the complete HTML file content with proper syntax highlighting
3. Highlight critical customizations made for this specific endpoint, particularly:
   - ID handling (integer vs UUID)
   - Tenant isolation requirements
   - Unique form fields or validation
   - Special error handling
4. Include testing instructions with specific commands to:
   - Verify the HTML file is accessible
   - Test the endpoint directly with curl
   - Open the page in a browser
   - Monitor logs for activity
5. Conclude each endpoint implementation with verification steps to confirm functionality
6. Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for all code
7. Format technical explanations with bullet points for clarity

## Target Audience

Your implementation is for developers who will use these test pages to verify the functionality of the RBAC API endpoints. They are familiar with the system but need clear, consistent interfaces for testing. They value complete, working code examples that follow the established pattern. They understand HTML, JavaScript, and API interactions but appreciate clear explanations of endpoint-specific customizations. They prefer a methodical approach that addresses one endpoint category at a time, with clear testing instructions for each.
