<think>You're right! The information we need is in the documentation file "44-Supabase-Connection-Configuration.md" that you shared. Let me analyze the key points:

1. **Important Infrastructure Changes**:

   - Supabase migrated from PgBouncer to Supavisor
   - They also migrated from IPv4 to IPv6

2. **Configuration Issue**:

   - The current code in `src/db/engine.py` is still configured for PgBouncer with `statement_cache_size=0`
   - According to the documentation: "PgBouncer required `statement_cache_size=0` to disable prepared statements, but this parameter causes errors with Supavisor."
   - The documentation specifically states this parameter should be removed when using Supavisor

3. **Supavisor Connection Format**:
   - The connection format has changed
   - New format: `postgresql+asyncpg://[db-user].[project-ref]:[password]@aws-0-[aws-region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/[db-name]`

Looking at the errors in the logs, they match exactly what's described in the documentation. The errors mention "prepared statement" issues which are related to the `statement_cache_size=0` parameter that should be removed for Supavisor.</think>You're absolutely right! The document "44-Supabase-Connection-Configuration.md" contains the exact information we need to fix the database connection issues.

Looking at the errors in the logs and comparing them with the documentation, I can see the problem:

1. Your application is now using Supavisor (the newer Supabase connection pooler) with the correct environment variables:

   - SUPABASE_POOLER_HOST
   - SUPABASE_POOLER_PORT
   - SUPABASE_POOLER_USER

2. However, in `src/db/engine.py`, you're still using the PgBouncer configuration with `statement_cache_size=0`. According to the documentation:

> **Issue**: PgBouncer required `statement_cache_size=0` to disable prepared statements, but this parameter causes errors with Supavisor.
>
> **Solution**: Remove the `statement_cache_size` parameter when using Supavisor.

Let's update the database engine configuration to fix this:

```python:src/db/engine.py
# Configure connect_args differently depending on connection type
connect_args = {
    "ssl": "require",           # SSL required for Supabase connections
    "command_timeout": settings.db_connection_timeout,  # Connection timeout
    "server_settings": {
        "search_path": "public",
        "application_name": "scraper_sky"
    }
}

# When using pgbouncer, add required settings
if db_config.pgbouncer_mode:
    # Add Supavisor compatibility options
    connect_args["server_settings"].update({
        "options": "-c search_path=public"
    })
else:
    # Only set statement_cache_size=0 for non-Supavisor connections
    # as per 44-Supabase-Connection-Configuration.md, this parameter
    # causes errors with Supavisor but was needed for PgBouncer
    connect_args["statement_cache_size"] = 0
```

Now let's restart the Docker container to apply these changes:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

Now let's check the logs to see if the connection issues are resolved:

```bash
docker-compose logs scrapersky | grep -i "error\|exception\|warning" | head -20
```

That looks good! The only warning is related to Pydantic V2, but no database connection errors. Let's check for more logs to confirm the database connection is working correctly:

```bash
docker-compose logs scrapersky | grep -i "engine\|connect\|pooler\|created\|starting" | head -20
```

Let's try a different approach to check if the server is running correctly:

```bash
docker-compose logs scrapersky --tail=30
```

Now let's test the /health endpoint to see if it's working properly and if it includes database connection status:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The health endpoint is responding with a 200 OK status, which suggests that the application is functioning correctly. Let's check if there are any endpoints to test that access the database:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/role_based_access_control/roles
```

Excellent! The roles endpoint is returning data successfully, which confirms that the database connection is working properly. Let's check another endpoint to be sure:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/role_based_access_control/permissions
```

Perfect! The permissions endpoint is also returning data successfully. One more endpoint to check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/role_based_access_control/features
```

Excellent! All the endpoints are working correctly, which confirms that the database connection is now functioning properly.

Let's check the Docker logs once more to make sure there are no errors:

```bash
docker-compose logs scrapersky | grep -i "error\|exception\|fail" | tail -20
```

Perfect! No errors in the logs. Let's summarize what we found and fixed:

## Summary

We successfully fixed the database connection issues by updating the configuration in `src/db/engine.py` to work correctly with Supabase's new Supavisor connection pooler. Here's what we learned and fixed:

1. **Issue Identified**: The errors in the logs showed problems with prepared statements, which is a known issue when using the `statement_cache_size=0` parameter with Supavisor (as documented in "44-Supabase-Connection-Configuration.md").

2. **Update Made**: We modified the database engine configuration to only apply `statement_cache_size=0` when NOT using the Supavisor pooler, as this parameter is specifically needed for the older PgBouncer but causes issues with Supavisor.

3. **Verification**: After restarting the Docker container, we tested multiple API endpoints that interact with the database, and they all returned data successfully:

   - `/health` endpoint works
   - `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/roles` returns data
   - `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/permissions` returns data
   - `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/features` returns data

4. **No More Errors**: The logs show no database connection errors after our changes.

The application is now correctly connecting to the Supabase database using the Supavisor connection pooler with the proper configuration. You've successfully migrated from PgBouncer to Supavisor as recommended in the documentation.

Would you like me to explain any other aspect of the database connection or make any additional improvements to the configuration?
