# RBAC Database Schema Rebuild

This document outlines the process for rebuilding the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) database schema for the ScraperSky backend.

## Background

The original RBAC database schema had several issues:

1. The `role_permissions` table used a custom type for the `role` column instead of a proper foreign key to the `roles` table
2. The `user_roles` table was missing entirely, preventing proper role assignment to users
3. There were inconsistencies between the database schema and what the application code expected

## Rebuild Process

The rebuild process involves three main steps:

1. **Drop existing RBAC tables** - Remove all existing RBAC-related tables to start with a clean slate
2. **Create new RBAC tables** - Create the tables with the correct structure and relationships
3. **Verify the tables** - Confirm that the tables have been created correctly

## Scripts

Three scripts have been created to facilitate this process:

### 1. `drop_rbac_tables.py`

This script drops all existing RBAC-related tables in the correct order to avoid foreign key constraint issues. It includes:

- `role_permissions`
- `user_roles` (if it exists)
- `sidebar_features`
- `tenant_features`
- `roles`
- `permissions`
- `feature_flags`

### 2. `create_rbac_tables.py`

This script creates the RBAC tables with the correct structure:

- `roles` - Basic role definitions (USER, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- `permissions` - Available permissions in the system
- `role_permissions` - Maps roles to permissions
- `user_roles` - Maps users to roles (previously missing)
- `feature_flags` - Feature toggle definitions
- `tenant_features` - Maps features to tenants
- `sidebar_features` - Defines sidebar UI elements for features

The script also populates the tables with default roles, permissions, and role-permission mappings.

### 3. `verify_rbac_tables.py`

This script verifies that the tables have been created correctly by checking:

- Table existence
- Column structure
- Foreign key relationships
- Row counts
- Sample data

## How to Use

1. **Set up environment variables**

   Make sure your database connection details are set in your environment variables:

   ```
   DB_HOST=aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com
   DB_PORT=6543
   DB_NAME=postgres
   DB_USER=postgres.ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   ```

2. **Drop existing tables**

   ```bash
   python drop_rbac_tables.py
   ```

   You will be prompted to confirm before tables are dropped.

3. **Create new tables**

   ```bash
   python create_rbac_tables.py
   ```

4. **Verify the tables**

   ```bash
   python verify_rbac_tables.py
   ```

## Key Changes

The key changes in the new schema are:

1. **`roles` table**:

   - Uses integer IDs (SERIAL) as primary keys
   - Includes name, description, and created_at columns

2. **`permissions` table**:

   - Uses UUID as primary keys
   - Includes name, description, created_at, and updated_at columns

3. **`role_permissions` table**:

   - Uses UUID as primary keys
   - Has proper foreign keys to both roles.id and permissions.id
   - Includes a unique constraint on (role_id, permission_id)

4. **`user_roles` table (new)**:

   - Maps users to roles with proper foreign keys
   - Includes a unique constraint on (user_id, role_id)

5. **Feature-related tables**:
   - Proper relationships between feature_flags, tenant_features, and sidebar_features

## After Rebuilding

After rebuilding the database schema, you should:

1. Update any application code that was working with the old schema
2. Test the RBAC functionality thoroughly
3. Update documentation to reflect the new schema

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the rebuild process:

- Check the database connection details
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and drop tables
- Look for error messages in the script output
- Verify that no application is actively using the tables during the rebuild

## Backup Recommendation

It's recommended to create a database backup before running these scripts in a production environment.
