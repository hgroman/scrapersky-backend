Below is an **all-in-one** reference document that captures the **complete** vision of your RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) solution as it stands: the **schema**, the **intended usage**, the **goals**, and the **practical realities** of how it all fits together. It’s designed so you can hand this to a second opinion—another engineer or architect—and they can see exactly where things stand and why.

# **ScraperSky RBAC “Big Picture” Documentation**

## **1. Why We Built It This Way**

**Goal**:
Create a **multi-tenant** RBAC system where:

1. Each **tenant** (client) has its own set of roles and associated side-bar features/tabs.
2. A **global admin** (you) can switch between tenants and manage them all.
3. **Regular** or **admin** users only see the features/tabs relevant to their tenant and their role.

**Constraints / Requirements**:

- Supabase is used for Auth. The actual “Users” table is **not** fully accessible. Instead, we have a **`profiles`** table automatically created per user.
- The **React** frontend must dynamically show/hide sidebar items based on roles and permissions.
- Each role can have multiple permissions, each permission can belong to multiple roles.
- Some advanced pieces are in place, like “feature flags” or “sidebar features,” for advanced toggling.

**Philosophy**:

- We wanted a **robust** design that uses “role” and “permission” tables for maximum flexibility.
- We also wanted a **multi-table** approach for future expansions (for instance, a “feature flag” system to enable/disable entire features by tenant).

**Reality**:

- It has become **complex**—multiple tables, advanced relationships, and migrations.
- MVP usage might not need all these advanced layers (like feature flags or user_roles for multi-tenant nuance).
- The code is extensive and can feel over-engineered for a small user base.

---

## **2. The Actual Schema**

You currently have **7+** core tables for RBAC plus a user `profiles` table. Below is a straightforward rundown of each:

1. **`profiles`** (Supabase-driven user profiles)

   - **id** (UUID, primary key)
   - **tenant_id** (text) – The tenant this user belongs to in your system (originally set for row-level isolation).
   - **role** (text) – Potentially used to store a single role for a user.
   - …plus typical fields like `name`, `email`, `created_at`, etc.
   - **Purpose**: This is your real user info. Whenever a user logs in with Supabase, an entry in `profiles` is created.

2. **`roles`**

   - **id** (integer, primary key)
   - **name** (text, e.g., “ADMIN”, “USER”)
   - **tenant_id** (UUID, references `tenants.id`)
   - **description** (text)
   - **created_at** (timestamp)
   - **Unique constraint**: (`name`, `tenant_id`) to ensure each role name is unique per tenant.
   - **Purpose**: A role describes a broad set of permissions (e.g., “ADMIN”, “USER”, “SUPER_ADMIN”).

3. **`permissions`**

   - **id** (UUID, primary key)
   - **name** (text, e.g., “view_dashboard”)
   - **description** (text)
   - **created_at**, **updated_at** (timestamps)
   - **Unique constraint**: `name` is globally unique across the entire system.
   - **Purpose**: Defines a specific action or capability.

4. **`role_permissions`**

   - **id** (UUID, primary key)
   - **role_id** (FK to `roles.id`)
   - **permission_id** (FK to `permissions.id`)
   - **created_at** (timestamp)
   - **Unique constraint**: `(role_id, permission_id)` so you can’t assign the same permission to a role more than once.
   - **Purpose**: Many-to-many “join table” so a single role can have multiple permissions.

5. **`user_roles`**

   - **id** (UUID, primary key)
   - **user_id** (UUID) – references the user’s Supabase “id” or `profiles.id` (depending on how you set it up)
   - **role_id** (integer) – references `roles.id`
   - **tenant_id** (UUID, sometimes optional)
   - **created_at**, **updated_at** (timestamps)
   - **Unique constraint**: `(user_id, role_id)`
   - **Purpose**: Another join table so a single user can have multiple roles.

6. **`feature_flags`**

   - **id** (UUID, pk)
   - **name** (text)
   - **description** (text)
   - **default_enabled** (bool)
   - **created_at**, **updated_at** (timestamps)
   - **Purpose**: Toggles for big “features” you can turn on/off per tenant. E.g. “advanced analytics.”

7. **`tenant_features`**

   - **id** (UUID, pk)
   - **tenant_id** (FK to `tenants.id`)
   - **feature_id** (FK to `feature_flags.id`)
   - **is_enabled** (bool)
   - **created_at**, **updated_at**
   - **Unique constraint**: `(tenant_id, feature_id)`
   - **Purpose**: Tracks which features are enabled for each tenant.

8. **`sidebar_features`**
   - **id** (UUID)
   - **feature_id** (UUID) – ties to `feature_flags.id`
   - **sidebar_name** (text)
   - **url_path** (text)
   - **requires_permission** (text, optional)
   - **tenant_id** (UUID, optional)
   - **Purpose**: UI-based table defining which side menu items appear for which feature, etc. Potentially you can store “Discovery Scan,” “Deep Analysis,” “Performance Insights,” etc.

**Additionally**:

- A `tenants` table (for multi-tenant isolation).
- Some references to a separate `users` table that you **cannot** directly query in Supabase but you do have `profiles` as the main user data.

---

## **3. How It’s Supposed to Work**

1. **User Logs in** (Supabase)

   - The user’s `profile` is auto-created or updated. You get a `profile.id` (UUID).

2. **User -> Roles**

   - The user can have multiple roles or a single role (depending on your usage) via `user_roles.user_id = profile.id`.
   - Each role belongs to a specific tenant.

3. **Role -> Permissions**

   - Each role can have multiple permissions (like “view_dashboard,” “edit_users”) via `role_permissions`.

4. **Sidebar**
   - The code sees “Which feature flags are enabled for the tenant?” and “Which sidebar items exist for those features?”
   - It also checks, “Do I require permission X to see this item?”
   - If yes, the user sees the item in the UI.

**All of that** means the system can do very fine-grained control if needed:

- “FEATURE: advanced scrapes” is turned on for Tenant B, but turned off for Tenant A.
- “ROLE: admin” can see advanced scrapes. “ROLE: user” cannot.
- “USER: Bob” is assigned to “admin,” so he sees it. “USER: Alice” is assigned to “user,” so she does not.

---

## **4. MVP Reality Check**

For an **MVP** you often do _not_ need all those layers:

- Typically, you can store each user’s role **directly** in `profiles.role`.
- The “permissions” could be a simple code-level check: “If role = admin => can do these things,” else “403 Forbidden.”

**But** the current system has become a larger architecture:

- 7+ tables for advanced toggles, multi-tenant toggles, etc.
- Fine-grained permissions, so you can add new permissions without code changes, in theory.

**Impact**:

- More code, more migrations, more mental overhead.
- Potentially powerful if you truly need multi-tenant toggles, advanced feature flags, and flexible roles.

---

## **5. The “In Theory” Data Flow**

1. **Authentication**

   - Supabase yields a JWT. The user’s `profile.id` is the key.

2. **RBAC Middleware** (FastAPI)

   - Decodes the JWT => get `profile.id` (the user).
   - Looks up that user in `user_roles` => sees which roles are assigned.
   - Looks up those roles in `role_permissions` => sees which permissions they have.
   - Also checks which features are turned on for that user’s tenant.
   - Decides if the request can proceed.

3. **UI React**
   - Possibly calls “/auth/validate” or a similar endpoint to fetch the user’s roles + permissions.
   - Renders the side bar items that match. Hides items that require a permission or feature the user lacks.

---

## **6. The Code & Endpoints**

### **Major Endpoints**:

1. **`/api/v3/rbac/roles`**

   - CRUD operations for roles
   - Expect integer IDs, a `tenant_id` (UUID).

2. **`/api/v3/rbac/permissions`**

   - CRUD operations for permissions
   - All UUID-based. Typically system-wide unique.

3. **`/api/v3/rbac/user-roles`**

   - Manage which roles a user has (the “user_id” is your `profiles.id`).
   - JSON body or path param indicates which role to add/remove.

4. **`/api/v3/rbac/features`** (Feature Flags)

   - CRUD for named “feature toggles.”

5. **`/api/v3/rbac/sidebar-features`**
   - If you’re using a DB approach to store the side nav items.
   - Possibly unused if you just code the sidebar in React.

### **Migrations & SQLAlchemy**

- The system has a set of Alembic migration files that create/alter these tables.
- `src/models/rbac.py` has classes for each table: `Role`, `Permission`, `RolePermission`, `UserRole`, `FeatureFlag`, `TenantFeature`, `SidebarFeature`, etc.

---

## **7. The Problems You’ve Faced**

1. **Over-Complex**

   - If you only have a handful of tenants, you might not need the entire multi-tenant toggles approach.
   - If you only want one role per user, you might not need the “many roles per user” bridging table.

2. **Unclear UI Flow**

   - The “sidebar_features” table is a solution for dynamic sidebars, but your React app can just code the sidebar items.
   - If the React app is going to hardcode sidebars, the table is “extra.”

3. **Performance**

   - Potential overhead from multi-join queries. Possibly fine for small user counts, but the complexity remains.

4. **Scope Creep**
   - Over the 90 days, the system expanded: more tables, more toggles.
   - Some advanced toggles (like “feature_flags,” “tenant_features,” “sidebar_features”) are not strictly needed for a minimal first release.

---

## **8. Is It All Required?**

**Short Answer**: No, not all if you want a simpler MVP.
But you’ve built it or nearly built it, so you could finish it if you do truly foresee multi-tenant feature toggles, role-based sidebars, etc.

**If you keep it**:

- You get ultimate flexibility: you can add new features in the DB, toggle them on a per-tenant basis, refine permissions, etc.
- The cost is mental overhead.

**If you revert**:

- You can collapse everything into ~2-3 tables (`profiles` for user info, `roles` for listing roles, and `user_roles` if you still want multi-roles).
- Hardcode the sidebars in React.

---

## **9. Conclusion & Hand-Off**

### **What’s Solved**

- You have a full-blown multi-table RBAC system that can handle advanced scenarios:
  1. **User** => `user_roles` => **Role** => `role_permissions` => **Permission**
  2. **Tenant** => `tenant_features` => **FeatureFlag** => `sidebar_features`
- You have the ability to do partial “feature gating” or “permission gating.”

### **What’s Painful**

- Maintaining these many tables and writing the test pages for each endpoint.
- Understanding how the React sidebar interacts with “sidebar_features,” if you even want it dynamic.
- Additional migrations and debugging.

### **What an Engineer Reviewing This Should Know**

- The design is “complete” for a robust multi-tenant, multi-role system, but it is heavier than some MVPs require.
- We strongly recommend verifying you truly need the advanced toggles, or else prune them out.

### **Next Steps**

1. **Decide** if you truly need every table (`feature_flags`, `tenant_features`, `sidebar_features`) for MVP.
2. **Finish** the missing HTML test pages or remove the code referencing them.
3. **Document** a simpler flow for everyday usage:
   - “We store a user’s single role in user_roles or `profiles.role`.”
   - “We check that role on the backend to show or hide certain pages.”
4. **(If you keep everything)**:
   - Write the test pages for user_roles, permissions, features, sidebar_features.
   - Confirm all endpoints are tested.

# **Final Word**

- You **can** keep the full solution with all advanced bits.
- Or you can drastically simplify.
- Either way, the above doc should clarify exactly **what** you built, **why** it’s big, and **how** all the pieces connect.

**Feel free to hand this doc** to a second opinion. They can see the entire architecture in one place and help weigh whether to proceed or prune.
