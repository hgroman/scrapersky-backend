# 77.11.2 - RBAC Tenant Features Implementation Fix

**Date**: March 9, 2025
**Subject**: Fix for Tenant Features API Endpoint
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Completed
**Estimated Effort**: 1 hour

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the issue and solution for the broken tenant features functionality in the RBAC system. The test-rbac-tenants.html page was failing to load features for tenants due to an endpoint URL mismatch.

## 2. Current Issues

1. **API Version Mismatch**: The tenant features page was using `/api/v3/features/tenant` but the new implementation was exposed at `/api/v4/features/tenant`

2. **Documentation Gap**: The new tenant features implementation wasn't clearly documented, leading to confusion about which endpoint to use.

## 3. Fix

1. Updated the test-rbac-tenants.html page to use the correct endpoint:
   ```javascript
   const TENANT_FEATURES_ENDPOINT = `${API_BASE_URL}/v4/features/tenant?raw_sql=true&no_prepare=true&statement_cache_size=0`;
   ```

2. Added documentation about the tenant features implementation in this document.

## 4. New Tenant Features Implementation

- Located in `src/routers/features.py` (API v4)
- Backed by utility functions in `src/utils/tenant_features.py`
- Provides a more direct, SQLAlchemy-based implementation
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v4/features/tenant` - Get features for current tenant
  - `POST /api/v4/features/tenant` - Update feature status for tenant
  - `GET /api/v4/sidebar` - Get sidebar items for current tenant

## 5. Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Verifying the API endpoint directly
2. Testing through the test-rbac-tenants.html page
3. Ensuring all tenant features are correctly displayed

## 6. Conclusion

This fix completes the trilogy of RBAC fix work orders:
1. 77.11.0 - RBAC Service Implementation Repair (Role-Permissions)
2. 77.11.1 - RBAC User-Role Implementation Repair
3. 77.11.2 - RBAC Tenant Features Implementation Fix (this document)

With these three fixes in place, the RBAC functionality should be fully operational.
