# Document 28: ScraperSky Modernization Progress Update - Batch Processor Service and Route Inventory

## 1. Executive Summary

The batch processor service modernization effort has been completed, with full implementation of the `/batch` and `/batch/{batch_id}/status` routes. The route inventory for the `sitemap_scraper.py` has been fully modernized with all legacy code either updated or archived. Additionally, the `/status/{job_id}` route and the `/debug-db-insert` route have now been modernized to use the service pattern. This document summarizes the current state of the batch processor modernization, including routes, supporting functions, and next steps.

## 2. Batch Processor Service Modernization

### 2.1. Implementation Overview

The `batch_processor_service.py` has been fully modernized to leverage SQLAlchemy ORM, following the patterns established in the job_service modernization. Key improvements include:

1. **Full SQLAlchemy Integration**:

   - Replaced all direct database operations with SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Implemented proper transaction boundaries with `session.begin()`
   - Added comprehensive relationship handling

2. **Type Safety and Error Handling**:

   - Created specialized attribute extraction utilities for SQLAlchemy models:
     - `_extract_attr` - Safely extracts any attribute
     - `_extract_datetime` - Safely extracts datetime fields
     - `_extract_int` - Safely extracts integer fields
     - `_extract_job_metadata` - Safely extracts job metadata
   - Added robust error handling throughout the service

3. **Service Integration**:

   - Updated to use modernized job_service API
   - Eliminated in-memory tracking in favor of SQLAlchemy database operations
   - Standardized method signatures and return types

4. **Concurrency and Progress Tracking**:
   - Maintained semaphore-based concurrency controls
   - Implemented proper batch progress tracking via job_service
   - Added transaction-safe updates for progress tracking

### 2.2. Key Methods and APIs

The modernized batch processor service provides these primary methods:

```python
# Process a batch of items with controlled concurrency
async def process_batch(items, processor_func, max_concurrent, tenant_id, user_id, batch_metadata, processor_type, batch_id)

# Process a batch of domains with a specific processor
async def process_domains_batch(domains, processor_type, tenant_id, user_id, options, max_concurrent, batch_id)

# Get status of a batch process
async def get_batch_status(batch_id, tenant_id)

# Cancel a running batch process
async def cancel_batch(batch_id, tenant_id)
```

### 2.3. SQLAlchemy Pattern Implementations

Key SQLAlchemy patterns implemented include:

1. **Session Management**:

   ```python
   async with get_session() as session:
       async with session.begin():
           # Database operations
   ```

2. **Safe Attribute Access**:

   ```python
   # Instead of direct access which can cause SQLAlchemy type errors
   value = cls._extract_attr(model, 'attribute_name', default_value)
   ```

3. **Type Conversion**:

   ```python
   # For datetime fields
   datetime_value = cls._extract_datetime(model, 'datetime_field')

   # For integer fields
   int_value = cls._extract_int(model, 'int_field', default=0)
   ```

4. **Relationship Handling**:
   ```python
   # Using proper SQLAlchemy relationship loading
   item = await service.get_by_id(session, item_id, load_relationships=True)
   ```
