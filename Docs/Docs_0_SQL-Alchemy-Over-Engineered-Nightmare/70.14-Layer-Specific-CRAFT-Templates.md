# Layer-Specific CRAFT Templates

## Overview

This document provides specialized CRAFT (Context, Role, Action, Format, Target) templates for different architectural layers of the ScraperSky backend. Breaking down tasks by architectural layer creates more focused, manageable work with clearer boundaries and reduces the risk of unintended changes.

## When to Use Layer-Specific Templates

Use these templates when:

1. Implementing or fixing functionality that spans multiple architectural layers
2. Working on complex features that require changes at different levels
3. Wanting to limit the scope of AI assistance to a specific layer
4. Needing to ensure changes in one layer don't affect others

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Identify the layer(s)** that need modification
2. **Select the appropriate template(s)** for those layers
3. **Customize the template** with specific details about your task
4. **Provide clear constraints** about what should not change
5. **Verify changes** at each layer before moving to the next

## Router Layer CRAFT Template

```markdown
# Router Layer CRAFT Prompt for [FEATURE_NAME]

## Context

We're implementing/fixing [FEATURE_NAME] following our reference implementation in [REFERENCE_FILE]. This prompt focuses EXCLUSIVELY on the router layer.

## Constraints

- PRESERVE all existing route paths (e.g., /features, NOT /feature-flags)
- PRESERVE all existing function names (e.g., get_features, NOT get_feature_flags)
- PRESERVE all error response keys (e.g., "get_features_error")
- DO NOT modify service layer calls except to add missing parameters
- DO NOT change authentication mechanisms

## Role

You are a FastAPI routing specialist who excels at implementing consistent API patterns while preserving existing integration points. Your expertise is in ensuring routes follow established patterns without breaking existing clients.

## Action

1. ANALYZE ONLY: Compare the current implementation with the reference
2. DOCUMENT: List all deviations in the routing layer only
3. PROPOSE: Suggest specific changes to align with the reference
4. AWAIT APPROVAL: Do not implement changes until explicitly approved
5. IMPLEMENT: Make only the approved changes to the routing layer

## Format

For your analysis, provide:

1. **Current Implementation**

   - Existing route paths and methods
   - Current parameter handling
   - Authentication/authorization approach
   - Response formatting

2. **Reference Pattern**

   - Expected route structure
   - Required parameters
   - Authentication requirements
   - Standard response format

3. **Proposed Changes**
   - Specific code additions/modifications
   - Explanation of each change
   - Impact assessment

## Success Criteria

- Routes match reference pattern while preserving existing paths
- All parameters are properly validated
- Authentication is correctly applied
- Responses follow standard format
- Frontend integration remains functional
```

## Service Layer CRAFT Template

   - Transaction management approach
   - Error handling strategy

## Success Criteria

- Methods implement business logic correctly
- Database queries follow established patterns
- Transactions are properly managed
- Caching is implemented where appropriate
- Error handling is consistent
```

## Database Layer CRAFT Template

```markdown
# Database Layer CRAFT Prompt for [FEATURE_NAME]

## Context

We're implementing/fixing [FEATURE_NAME] following our reference implementation in [REFERENCE_FILE]. This prompt focuses EXCLUSIVELY on the database layer.

## Constraints

- PRESERVE all existing table names
- PRESERVE all existing column names
- DO NOT modify existing indexes
- DO NOT change relationship definitions
- DO NOT modify service or router layer code

## Role

You are a database specialist who excels at implementing efficient and consistent data models. Your expertise is in ensuring database interactions follow established patterns while maintaining data integrity.

## Action

1. ANALYZE ONLY: Compare the current implementation with the reference
2. DOCUMENT: List all missing or incorrect database models/queries
3. PROPOSE: Suggest specific model definitions or query optimizations
4. AWAIT APPROVAL: Do not implement changes until explicitly approved
5. IMPLEMENT: Make only the approved changes to the database layer

## Format

For your analysis, provide:

1. **Current Implementation**

   - Existing models and schemas
   - Current query patterns
   - Index definitions
   - Relationship mappings

2. **Reference Pattern**

   - Expected model structure
   - Optimal query patterns

   - Index additions
   - Relationship adjustments

## Success Criteria

- Models match reference pattern
- Queries are optimized for performance
- Indexes support common query patterns
- Relationships are properly defined

## Integration Testing CRAFT Template

```markdown
# Integration Testing CRAFT Prompt for [FEATURE_NAME]

- All endpoints have integration tests
- Service methods have unit tests
- Database queries are verified
- Frontend integration is confirmed
- Error cases are properly tested
```

## Best Practices for Layer-Specific Development

1. **Work Bottom-Up**: Start with database layer, then service layer, then router layer
2. **Test Each Layer**: Verify changes at each layer before moving to the next
3. **Maintain Separation**: Keep changes isolated to their specific layer
4. **Document Dependencies**: Note any cross-layer dependencies
5. **Preserve Interfaces**: Don't change method signatures or return types that other layers depend on

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**: Modifying more than the specified layer
2. **Name Changes**: Changing route paths, function names, or error keys
3. **Interface Breaking**: Modifying method signatures or return types
4. **Pattern Overriding**: Implementing patterns that don't match the reference
5. **Premature Optimization**: Making performance improvements without evidence

By following these layer-specific templates, you can ensure more focused, safer changes to the ScraperSky backend while maintaining architectural integrity and preventing unintended side effects.
