# 71.0 - ScraperSky Project Cleanup and Reorganization

**Date: March 7, 2025**

**Summary:** This document describes the comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the ScraperSky project structure, focusing on standardizing database connectivity patterns and organizing utility scripts.

## Cleanup Performed

1. **Script Organization:**
   - Archived 39 outdated or redundant scripts
   - Organized into logical categories: db_inspection, db_operations, rbac_legacy, testing, obsolete
   - Retained 13 actively used scripts
   - Created clear README and organization documentation

2. **Database Standards:**
   - Created `CLAUDE.md` with definitive database connection guidance
   - Updated `README.md` with clear database connection instructions
   - Added new `DB_OPERATIONS.md` with comprehensive database operations guide
   - Created `enforce_db_standards.py` to detect and fix non-compliant code

3. **New Database Tools:**
   - Added `inspect_table.py` for easy interactive table browsing
   - Enhanced `test_db_connection.py` for comprehensive connection testing
   - Created DB utility scripts with standardized access patterns

4. **Root Directory Cleanup:**
   - Moved root-level utility scripts to archive/root_scripts/
   - Organized documentation and utility files
   - Created clear guidance in scripts/README.md and scripts/ORGANIZATION.md

## How to Use the New Tools

### Database Inspection

```bash
# Browse tables interactively
python scripts/inspect_table.py

# View a specific table
python scripts/inspect_table.py roles --limit 10

# Filter table data
python scripts/inspect_table.py permissions --where "name='access_dashboard'"

# Inspect RBAC structure
python scripts/inspect_rbac_tables.py
```

### Database Connection Testing

```bash
# Test database connection
python scripts/test_db_connection.py

# Basic utilities
python db_tools.py tables
python db_tools.py schema roles
python db_tools.py count permissions
```

### Code Standards Enforcement

```bash
# Check for database standards violations
python scripts/enforce_db_standards.py

# Fix automatically fixable issues
python scripts/enforce_db_standards.py --fix
```

## Documentation

1. [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) - Definitive database connection standards
2. [DB_OPERATIONS.md](./DB_OPERATIONS.md) - Comprehensive database operations guide
3. [scripts/README.md](./scripts/README.md) - Overview of available scripts
4. [scripts/ORGANIZATION.md](./scripts/ORGANIZATION.md) - Detailed script organization

## Next Steps

1. Familiarize team members with the new tools and documentation
2. Use the `enforce_db_standards.py` script regularly to maintain code quality
3. Add new scripts to the appropriate categories following the established patterns
4. Reference the documentation when working with the database
