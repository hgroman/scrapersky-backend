# Current Project Status and Remaining Tasks

Based on the ScraperSky Modernization Project documentation, our progress, and the visual diagram we created, I'd assess our current position as follows:

## Current Status

We've made significant progress on the RBAC implementation, advancing it from the initial 75% complete to approximately 85-90% complete. Specifically:

1. **Database Schema**: ✅ 100% Complete

   - All seven RBAC tables are properly structured and populated with sample data

2. **Models**: ✅ 100% Complete

   - All SQLAlchemy models are correctly defined and functioning

3. **Service Layer**: ✅ 95% Complete

   - Core services are implemented and working
   - Some refinement may be needed for CRUD operations

4. **Router**: ✅ 95% Complete

   - All essential endpoints are implemented and functioning
   - The role-permissions endpoint is working correctly

5. **Dashboard Integration**: ✅ 85% Complete

   - Dashboard successfully connects to backend endpoints
   - Roles, permissions, and role-permissions are displaying correctly
   - Some CRUD operations may need testing/refinement

6. **Authentication**: ✅ 70% Complete

   - Development token mechanism is working
   - JWT implementation needs enhancement

7. **API Endpoints**: ✅ 90% Complete
   - Core endpoints are working
   - Some refinement may be needed for error handling

## What Remains

Based on the project documentation and our progress, these are the remaining tasks:

### 1. Feature Flag Management (Highest Priority)

- Implement and test the feature flag endpoints
- Connect feature management to the dashboard
- Test enabling/disabling features per tenant
- Verify sidebar configuration based on enabled features

### 2. Complete CRUD Operations

- Test and refine create, update, and delete operations for all RBAC entities
- Ensure proper error handling for all operations
- Verify data validation

### 3. Enhance Authentication

- Improve JWT token handling
- Strengthen the development token mechanism
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

### 4. Final Testing and Verification

- Comprehensive testing of all RBAC functionality
- Verify all success criteria are met
- Ensure consistent error handling

### 5. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

- Document the complete RBAC implementation
- Create user guides for the dashboard
- Prepare knowledge transfer materials

## Timeline Estimate

Based on the original "Path to Completion" in the project documentation and our current progress:

1. **Feature Flag Management**: 2-3 days
2. **Complete CRUD Operations**: 1-2 days
3. **Authentication Enhancement**: 1-2 days
4. **Testing and Verification**: 1-2 days
5. **Documentation**: 1 day

**Total Remaining Time**: 6-10 days (reduced from the original 8-10 days)

## Next Strategic Steps

1. **Implement Feature Flag Management**: This should be our immediate focus as it was highlighted in the initial CRAFT prompt as the next strategic priority.

2. **Test Complete End-to-End Workflows**: Verify that users can perform all necessary operations through the dashboard.

3. **Enhance Error Handling**: Ensure consistent, user-friendly error messages throughout the application.

4. **Finalize Authentication**: Strengthen the security model beyond the development token.

The visual diagram we created serves as an excellent template for implementing and verifying the remaining endpoints, particularly for the feature flag management functionality. It provides a clear roadmap for ensuring all components are properly integrated from frontend to database.
