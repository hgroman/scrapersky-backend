<think>The user is asking me to zoom out and provide an overview of the progress I've made so far on implementing the RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) sidebar features. Let me summarize what we've accomplished and what issues we've encountered.</think># Progress Summary on RBAC Sidebar Feature Implementation

I've been working on implementing the Role-Based Access Control for sidebar features, focusing on ensuring proper tenant-based filtering and fixing database schema issues. Here's an overview of what we've accomplished and the current status:

## Database Schema Updates ‚úÖ

1. Successfully added the missing columns to the database schema:

   - Added `tenant_id` column (UUID type) to the `sidebar_features` table
   - Added `updated_at` column (timestamp with time zone) to the `user_roles` table
   - Set initial values for `updated_at` based on `created_at` values

2. Used a direct database approach with `psycopg2` to bypass SQLAlchemy/asyncpg prepared statement issues with pgbouncer.

## Code Implementation ‚úÖ

1. Updated the `get_sidebar_features` function in `feature_service.py` to filter by tenant_id:

   ```python
   sidebar_stmt = select(SidebarFeature).where(
       and_(
           SidebarFeature.feature_id.in_(enabled_feature_ids),
           or_(
               SidebarFeature.tenant_id.is_(None),  # Allow global items
               SidebarFeature.tenant_id == tenant_id  # Or tenant-specific items
           )
       )
   )
   ```

2. Updated the response format to include the tenant_id in the returned feature dictionaries.

## Testing ‚úÖ

1. Created a test script that runs multiple scenarios:

   - Superadmin user with all permissions
   - User with limited permissions
   - User from a different tenant

2. Updated unit tests to verify the tenant filtering logic.

## Current Issues & Observations üîç

From the logs provided, I can see that there are still some database query errors occurring:

1. `UndefinedColumnError`: Some queries are still failing because they're trying to access columns that might not exist in all environments:

   - `column user_roles.tenant_id does not exist`
   - `column sidebar_features.tenant_id does not exist`
   - `column user_roles.updated_at does not exist`

2. pgbouncer connection pooling issues causing prepared statement errors:
   - `prepared statement "__asyncpg_xxxx__" does not exist`
   - This is a known issue with pgbouncer in transaction/statement modes

## Next Steps üöÄ

1. Verify all database schema updates have been applied correctly across all environments
2. Monitor for any remaining prepared statement issues in the pgbouncer setup
3. Finalize testing with real tenant data to ensure proper separation between tenants
4. Consider implementing a db connection helper that handles the pgbouncer prepared statement limitation

Do you need me to focus on any particular aspect of this implementation or address specific issues from the logs?
