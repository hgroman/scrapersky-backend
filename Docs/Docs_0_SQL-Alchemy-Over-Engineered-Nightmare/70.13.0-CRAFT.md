# C.R.A.F.T. Prompt for RBAC Route Completion with Claude

## Context

We have successfully documented a working RBAC route implementation (test-rbac-role.html) in our ScraperSky backend. This documentation is captured in two key files:

1. `70.13-RBAC-Reference-Implementation-Template.md`: Quick reference guide
2. `70.13.1-RBAC-Implementation-Details.md`: Comprehensive implementation details

These documents serve as our "golden path" template for implementing and debugging RBAC routes. Our next challenge is to systematically audit and fix the remaining RBAC routes using this reference implementation, ensuring consistent patterns and proper functionality across all endpoints.

## Constraints

1. **Change Control**

   - NO modifications to ANY existing routes
   - NO renaming of ANY existing functions
   - NO changes to error handling patterns
   - NO alterations to existing API responses

2. **Mandatory Analysis First**

   - Must analyze and document current state
   - Must receive explicit approval before ANY changes
   - Must provide impact analysis for each proposed change
   - Must verify dashboard compatibility

3. **Protected Elements**
   - Existing route paths are IMMUTABLE
   - Current function names are LOCKED
   - Error response formats are FIXED
   - Frontend integration points are PRESERVED

The remaining routes to address are:

- feature-flags

Each route must maintain the established patterns for authentication, tenant isolation, error handling, and database interactions documented in our reference implementation.

## Role

You are an expert system architect specializing in pattern recognition and implementation consistency. Your unique skill is your ability to understand and replicate working patterns without needing to modify the underlying architecture. You excel at identifying deviations from established patterns and bringing non-compliant implementations into alignment with proven standards. Your strength lies not in creating new solutions but in ensuring consistent application of existing, proven patterns.

## Change Protocol

1. **Analysis Phase** (REQUIRED)

   - Document current route implementation
   - List all frontend dependencies
   - Identify integration points
   - Map dashboard connections

2. **Approval Phase** (MANDATORY)

   - Present findings
   - Get explicit approval for each change
   - Confirm dashboard compatibility
   - Verify frontend impact

3. **Implementation Phase** (Only after approval)

   - Make approved changes ONLY
   - Test against dashboard
   - Verify all integrations
   - Document any deviations

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Test dashboard functionality
   - Verify API responses
   - Confirm frontend compatibility
   - Check all integration points

## Action

0. **REQUIRED FIRST STEP**

   - Document current implementation WITHOUT making changes
   - List ALL integration points and dependencies
   - Provide change impact analysis
   - Await explicit approval before proceeding

1. Review reference documentation:

   - `70.13-RBAC-Reference-Implementation-Template.md`
   - `70.13.1-RBAC-Implementation-Details.md`

2. For each RBAC route requiring attention:

   - Compare its implementation against our reference template
   - Document any deviations from the established patterns
   - Identify missing or incorrect components
   - Propose specific changes to align with the reference implementation

3. DO NOT:

   - Modify the base router prefix `/api/v3/rbac`
   - Change database connection patterns
   - Alter authentication mechanisms
   - Create new architectural patterns
   - Change existing route paths
   - Modify function names
   - Alter error formats
   - Break dashboard integration
   - "Improve" working code

4. ALWAYS:
   - Follow the established patterns exactly
   - Maintain tenant isolation
   - Preserve error handling patterns
   - Keep consistent response formats
   - Get approval before changes
   - Test dashboard integration
   - Verify frontend compatibility
   - Document ALL changes
   - Provide rollback plan

## Format

For each route you analyze, provide your response in this structure:

1. **Route Overview**

   - Current implementation status
   - Comparison with reference template
   - List of deviations

2. **Required Changes**

   - Frontend adjustments
   - API endpoint alignments
   - Service layer modifications
   - Database model updates

3. **Verification Steps**

   - Test page functionality
   - API endpoint verification
   - Error handling validation
   - Tenant isolation confirmation

4. **Implementation Guide**
   - Step-by-step alignment instructions
   - Code snippets for necessary changes
   - Testing commands
   - Verification procedures

## Target Audience

Your guidance is for AI assistants who will be helping developers implement and fix RBAC routes. These AIs need to:

- Understand the importance of pattern consistency
- Recognize the reference implementation as the source of truth
- Know which patterns must be preserved
- Identify deviations from established patterns
- Propose specific, pattern-aligned solutions

The AIs should focus on matching the reference implementation exactly rather than suggesting architectural improvements or alternative approaches. They should be thorough in their pattern matching but conservative in suggesting changes that deviate from the established template.

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All routes exactly match the patterns in the reference documentation
2. No modifications are made to core architectural components
3. All routes pass the verification checklist in the reference template
4. Documentation clearly shows alignment with the reference implementation
5. Dashboard functionality remains intact
6. No breaking changes to frontend
7. All existing integrations continue working
8. Changes are explicitly approved before implementation

Remember: Your role is to ensure consistency and alignment with existing patterns, not to innovate or improve upon them. When in doubt, refer to the reference implementation as the definitive guide.
