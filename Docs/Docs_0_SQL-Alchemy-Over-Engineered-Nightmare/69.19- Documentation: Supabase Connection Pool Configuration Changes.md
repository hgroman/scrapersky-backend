<think>The user wants me to document the changes we made to fix the connection pooler issue with Supabase. I should create a comprehensive documentation of what we changed, why we changed it, and how it helped.

Key points to document:

1. The initial issue with the Supabase connection (moving from PgBouncer to Supavisor)
2. The specific changes made to the connection string format (username.project_ref format)
3. The `statement_cache_size=0` parameter that was added to the connection configuration
4. How these changes resolved the prepared statement errors

I should organize this clearly and provide technical details for future reference.</think># Documentation: Supabase Connection Pool Configuration Changes

## Issue Resolved

Successfully migrated the ScraperSky application from PgBouncer to Supavisor connection pooling by implementing changes to the database connection configuration.

## Background

Supabase has migrated from PgBouncer to Supavisor for connection pooling. This migration required changes to our connection string format and connection parameters to ensure compatibility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Connection String Format Update

Modified the connection string in `src/session/async_session.py` to support the Supavisor-required format:

```python
# Extract project reference from Supabase URL
if settings.supabase_url:
    if '//' in settings.supabase_url:
        project_ref = settings.supabase_url.split('//')[1].split('.')[0]
    else:
        project_ref = settings.supabase_url.split('.')[0]

# Format the user part correctly for Supavisor
if pooler_user and '.' in pooler_user:
    user_part = pooler_user
elif project_ref:
    user_part = f"{pooler_user}.{project_ref}" if pooler_user else f"postgres.{project_ref}"
else:
    user_part = pooler_user or "postgres"
```

This ensures the connection user is in the format `[db-user].[project-ref]` which is required by Supavisor.

### 2. Statement Cache Configuration

Added the `statement_cache_size=0` parameter to the SQLAlchemy engine configuration in `async_session.py`:

```python
connect_args = {
    "ssl": ssl_context,
    "statement_cache_size": 0,  # Add statement_cache_size=0 to properly handle Supavisor connection
    "prepared_statement_name_func": lambda: f"__asyncpg_{uuid.uuid4()}__"
}
```

This change was crucial to prevent prepared statement errors that were occurring with the Supavisor connection pooler. Setting `statement_cache_size=0` disables the client-side prepared statement caching, which prevents conflicts when using Supavisor.

## Results

The changes successfully:

1. Established proper connection format for Supavisor
2. Eliminated prepared statement errors that were previously appearing in the logs
3. Improved application performance and stability
4. Maintained compatibility with the Supabase infrastructure changes

## Remaining Issues

Database schema mismatches still exist:

- `user_roles.tenant_id` column is referenced but does not exist
- `sidebar_features.requires_feature` column is referenced but does not exist

These issues are not related to the connection pooler configuration and will need to be addressed separately.
