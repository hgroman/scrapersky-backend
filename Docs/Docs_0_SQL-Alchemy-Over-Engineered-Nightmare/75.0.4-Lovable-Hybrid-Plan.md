Hybrid Approach Implementation Plan

Since you already have the backend middleware, endpoints, and database tables in place, we'll focus on how to adapt our current React implementation to work effectively with this approach.

Step 1: Update the RBACContext.tsx Implementation

Our current implementation fetches all RBAC data including feature flags. We need to modify it to focus on the core role-based permissions while removing the feature flag complexity.

Here's what we need to change:

Step 2: Database Schema Adjustments (Optional)

While we're keeping the core RBAC tables, here's what you should consider doing on your backend:

Keep these tables intact:
roles
permissions
role_permissions
user_roles
sidebar_features (adjusted to work without feature_flags dependency)
Modify sidebar_features table to remove dependency on feature_flags:
Update to use direct permission requirements instead of feature_id references
Add a requires_permission column if not already present
Stop using these tables (you can keep them in the schema for future use):
feature_flags
tenant_features
Step 3: Backend Middleware Adjustments

Your existing middleware should:

Continue checking user permissions as before
Simplify the feature access check to just use permission checks instead of feature flags
Use permission-based logic for API endpoint protection
Step 4: SQL Query to Update Sidebar Features

If your sidebar_features table currently depends on feature_flags, you may need to update it. Here's a suggested SQL you could run:

-- Add requires_permission column if it doesn't exist
ALTER TABLE sidebar_features ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS requires_permission TEXT;

-- Update requires_permission based on feature_id
UPDATE sidebar_features
SET requires_permission = 'view_' || (
  SELECT name FROM feature_flags WHERE id = feature_id
)
WHERE requires_permission IS NULL AND feature_id IS NOT NULL;

Step 5: Testing Plan

Test Authentication Flow:
Login with different user roles
Verify correct permissions are loaded
Test Sidebar Rendering:
Verify only authorized sidebar items are shown
Check that dynamic sidebar items respect permissions
Test Feature Access:
Try accessing protected routes directly
Ensure middleware properly blocks unauthorized access
Advantages of This Approach

Simplified Implementation: Removes feature flag complexity while maintaining role-based security
Reduced Database Queries: No need to fetch feature flags or tenant features
Clear Permission Model: Direct mapping between permissions and UI elements
Future Expandability: Core RBAC structure remains in place for future enhancements
Next Steps

After implementing these changes, you should have a streamlined RBAC system that:

Maintains multi-tenant support
Provides granular permission control
Dynamically renders the UI based on user permissions
Avoids the complexity of feature flags until they're needed
