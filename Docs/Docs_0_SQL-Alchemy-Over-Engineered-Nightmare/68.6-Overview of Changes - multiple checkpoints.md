## Overview of Changes

Three critical API endpoints in the RBAC dashboard integration were non-functional, preventing proper operation of the User-Roles, Tenant-Features, and Sidebar-Features components. All issues have been identified and resolved through targeted code modifications.

## 1. User-Roles Endpoint Fix

**Issue:** The `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/user-roles` endpoint returned a 405 "Method Not Allowed" error because no GET handler was registered for retrieving all user roles.

**Solution:**

- Added a new `get_all_user_roles` method to the `RbacService` class in `src/services/rbac/rbac_service.py` (lines 821-857)
- Implemented and registered a `get_all_user_roles_endpoint` function in `src/router_factory/rbac_router.py` (lines 346-382)

**Implementation Details:**

```python
async def get_all_user_roles(
    self,
    session: AsyncSession,
    tenant_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Get all user-role assignments.

    Args:
        session: Database session
        tenant_id: Optional tenant ID to filter assignments

    Returns:
        List of user-role assignments as dictionaries
    """
    try:
        # Query to get UserRole objects with associated Role information
        stmt = select(UserRole, Role).join(
            Role,
            UserRole.role_id == Role.id
        )

        # Apply tenant filter if provided
        if tenant_id:
            normalized_tenant_id = self.normalize_tenant_id(tenant_id)
            stmt = stmt.where(UserRole.tenant_id == normalized_tenant_id)

        result = await session.execute(stmt)
        user_roles = result.all()

        # Format the results with role details included
        formatted_results = []
        for user_role, role in user_roles:
            user_role_dict = model_to_dict(user_role)
            role_dict = model_to_dict(role)
            user_role_dict["role"] = role_dict
            formatted_results.append(user_role_dict)

        return formatted_results
    except SQLAlchemyError as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting all user roles: {str(e)}")
        return []
```

## 2. Tenant-Features Endpoint Fix

**Issue:** The `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/tenant-features` endpoint returned a 500 server error due to an attribute error. The code was referencing `TenantFeature.enabled` while the actual model uses `TenantFeature.is_enabled`.

**Solution:**

- Updated the query in `get_tenant_features` method in `src/services/rbac/feature_service.py` (line 97)
- Changed `TenantFeature.enabled` to `TenantFeature.is_enabled` to match the model definition

**Implementation Details:**

```python
# Query to get all features and their status for a tenant
stmt = select(FeatureFlag.name, TenantFeature.is_enabled) \
    .outerjoin(
        TenantFeature,
        and_(
            FeatureFlag.id == TenantFeature.feature_id,
            TenantFeature.tenant_id == tenant_id
        )
    )
```

## 3. Sidebar-Features Endpoint Fix

**Issue:** The `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/sidebar-features` endpoint returned a 500 server error due to an attribute error. The code was trying to filter by `SidebarFeature.tenant_id`, which doesn't exist in the model, and using `SidebarFeature.order` instead of `SidebarFeature.display_order`.

**Solution:**

- Updated the `get_sidebar_features` method in `src/services/rbac/feature_service.py` (lines 293-334)
- Changed the query to join with `FeatureFlag` and `TenantFeature` to filter by tenant
- Added the missing `requires_permission` field to the `SidebarFeature` model in `src/models/rbac.py`

**Implementation Details:**

```python
# Since SidebarFeature may not have a tenant_id column,
# we'll instead join with TenantFeature to check if the feature is enabled for this tenant
stmt = select(SidebarFeature).join(
    FeatureFlag,
    SidebarFeature.feature_id == FeatureFlag.id
).join(
    TenantFeature,
    and_(
        FeatureFlag.id == TenantFeature.feature_id,
        TenantFeature.tenant_id == tenant_id,
        TenantFeature.is_enabled == True
    )
).order_by(SidebarFeature.display_order)
```

Added to SidebarFeature model:

```python
requires_permission = Column(String, nullable=True)
```

## Verification and Testing

The fixes were verified by:

1. Checking the implementation against the database schema
2. Ensuring the SQLAlchemy models match the actual database tables
3. Verifying that the endpoint functions are registered properly

## Impact

These fixes enable:

- Complete functionality of the RBAC dashboard
- Full user role management capabilities
- Tenant-specific feature management
- UI navigation configuration via sidebar features

All seven components of the RBAC dashboard (Roles, Permissions, Role-Permissions, User-Roles, Feature Flags, Tenant Features, and Sidebar Features) should now be fully operational.

## Next Steps

1. Verify functioning with Docker restart:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Conduct comprehensive testing of all RBAC endpoints
3. Update any remaining frontend code that might need adjustments
4. Document the relationship between SidebarFeature and TenantFeature for future developers

Here's a summary of the changes I've made to fix the role-permission assignments and other non-working components:
Role-Permission Assignments Fix:
Modified get_all_role_permissions_endpoint in rbac_router.py to return a direct array instead of a nested object
Updated get_all_role_permissions method in rbac_service.py to include the assigned_at field that the frontend expects
User-Role Assignments Fix:
Modified get_all_user_roles_endpoint in rbac_router.py to return a direct array
Updated get_all_user_roles method in rbac_service.py to format results with user_id, role_id, role_name, and created_at fields
Tenant-Features Fix:
Modified get_tenant_features_endpoint in rbac_router.py to return the features list directly
Sidebar-Features Fix:
Modified get_sidebar_features_endpoint in rbac_router.py to return sidebar features directly
The issue was that the frontend was expecting direct arrays but the endpoints were returning objects with nested arrays (like {"role_permissions": [...]} instead of just [...]). I've fixed all endpoints to return the data in the format expected by the frontend.
Now you can verify these changes by restarting Docker:
