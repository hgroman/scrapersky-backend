Below is a **refactored version** of your `permission_middleware.py` that **only handles authentication** (i.e., extracts user info from the JWT or dev token) and **attaches it to the request state**. All **endpoint permission checks** would be removed from the middleware, so you’d do them inside your API handlers / services instead. This keeps development simpler and stops you from fighting with path-based regex checks in the middleware.

## **Refactored `permission_middleware.py`**

```python
"""
Refactored Permission Middleware

This version only handles authentication, extracting user + tenant info from
the headers/token and attaching them to request.state. It does not do
any endpoint-based permission checks or feature flag checks.
Those should be handled in your business logic or API route handlers.

### **Key Changes from Your Original Middleware**

1. **No Path-Based Permission Checks**
   - We removed the entire concept of `(method, path_regex) -> required_permission`.
   - The middleware **only** checks whether the user is authenticated or in dev mode.

2. **No Feature Flag Checks**
   - The `check_feature_enabled` logic is gone.
   - You handle any feature flags inside your route handlers or services (like `feature_service.py`).

3. **Separated Auth from Authorization**
   - Middleware does **only** authentication, ensuring the user is valid and sets `request.state.user`.
   - Actual RBAC checks belong in your API or service logic.

4. **Dev Bypass**
   - We kept the `scraper_sky_2024` dev token logic.
   - This way, you can test or skip auth in dev.

---

### **How You’d Do RBAC Now**

- **Middleware**: Confirms the user is valid, sets `request.state.user` → `{'id': ..., 'tenant_id': ..., 'roles': ...}`
- **Route Handler**: Access `request.state.user`, call your **RBAC** or **Feature Service** to see if the user is allowed to do the requested action.

**For example**, in your route:
```python
@router.get("/sidebar-features")
async def get_sidebar_features_endpoint(request: Request, session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session)):
    user = request.state.user
    # Check if user has the right permission for this route
    # or call your business logic that checks user["roles"], etc.
    # Then retrieve the actual features from your feature_service
    return await feature_service.get_sidebar_features(
        session,
        user["tenant_id"],
        user_roles=user.get("roles", []),
    )
```

---

### **Why This Simplifies Local Dev**

1. **You can skip the entire RBAC** in dev if you want.
2. **You don’t break your production** environment—production still requires JWT tokens.
3. **No mysterious 401/403** from a black-box middleware that’s regex-checking your endpoints.
4. If a route denies the user, you’ll see exactly **which part of the route logic** did so.

---

### **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Swap in** this new `AuthMiddleware` in place of your current `permission_middleware`.
2. **Remove** references to the old permission-based regex from your `main.py` or whichever file adds the current middleware.
3. **Refactor** your route handlers or services to do the actual permission checks.

**Remember**: This approach is usually easier to maintain and debug because you **only** do user authentication in the middleware, leaving RBAC checks for the **actual business logic**.

---

### **Conclusion**
**Yes, you can absolutely adopt a simpler approach**. This reworked `permission_middleware.py` solves the **time-suck** you’ve been experiencing by **separating authentication from RBAC**. You’ll still need to handle **permission checks** in your route logic, but **that’s easier to debug** and more flexible for local dev.
