# RBAC Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in the ScraperSky backend. The RBAC system controls user access to various API endpoints and features based on assigned roles and permissions.

## Architecture

The RBAC implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Database Models**: SQLAlchemy ORM models for roles, permissions, user roles, features, and tenant features.
2. **RBAC Service**: Service layer for managing roles, permissions, and user-role assignments.
3. **Feature Service**: Service layer for managing feature flags and sidebar features.
4. **Permission Middleware**: FastAPI middleware that enforces permission checks on API endpoints.
5. **JWT Authentication**: Authentication mechanism that identifies users and their tenants.

## Database Schema

### Roles

The `roles` table stores role definitions:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Role name (e.g., "admin", "user")
- `description`: Role description
- `tenant_id`: UUID of the tenant this role belongs to
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the role was created

### Permissions

The `permissions` table stores permission definitions:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Permission name (e.g., "read_data", "write_data")
- `description`: Permission description
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the permission was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the permission was last updated

### Role Permissions

The `role_permissions` table maps roles to permissions:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `role_id`: UUID of the role
- `permission_id`: UUID of the permission

### User Roles

The `user_roles` table assigns roles to users:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `user_id`: UUID of the user
- `role_id`: UUID of the role
- `tenant_id`: UUID of the tenant
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the user role was assigned

### Features

The `features` table stores feature flag definitions:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Feature name (e.g., "batch_processing", "advanced_analytics")
- `title`: Display title for the feature
- `description`: Feature description
- `default_enabled`: Boolean indicating if the feature is enabled by default
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the feature was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the feature was last updated

### Tenant Features

The `tenant_features` table maps features to tenants:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `tenant_id`: UUID of the tenant
- `feature_id`: UUID of the feature
- `enabled`: Boolean indicating if the feature is enabled for this tenant
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the tenant feature was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the tenant feature was last updated

### Sidebar Features

The `sidebar_features` table defines UI navigation items:

- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Feature name
- `title`: Display title
- `icon`: Icon name
- `path`: URL path
- `permission_name`: Required permission to see this sidebar item
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the sidebar feature was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the sidebar feature was last updated

## Services

### RBAC Service

The RBAC service (`src/services/rbac/rbac_service.py`) provides methods for:

- Creating and managing roles
- Creating and managing permissions
- Assigning roles to users
- Retrieving user permissions
- Checking if a user has a specific permission

Key methods:

- `get_user_permissions(session, user_id, tenant_id)`: Retrieves all permissions for a user
- `create_permission(session, name, description)`: Creates a new permission
- `create_role(session, name, description, tenant_id, permission_ids)`: Creates a new role with permissions
- `assign_role_to_user(session, user_id, role_id, tenant_id)`: Assigns a role to a user

### Feature Service

The Feature service (`src/services/rbac/feature_service.py`) provides methods for:

- Creating and managing feature flags
- Enabling/disabling features for tenants
- Checking if a feature is enabled for a tenant
- Managing sidebar features for UI navigation

Key methods:

- `is_feature_enabled_for_tenant(session, feature_name, tenant_id)`: Checks if a feature is enabled
- `set_feature_status(session, feature_name, tenant_id, enabled)`: Enables/disables a feature
- `get_sidebar_features(session, tenant_id, user_permissions)`: Gets sidebar items based on permissions

## Permission Middleware

The Permission Middleware (`src/middleware/permission_middleware.py`) enforces permission checks on API endpoints. It:

1. Extracts user and tenant IDs from request headers
2. Determines the required permission for the endpoint
3. Checks if the user has the required permission
4. Checks if any required feature flags are enabled
5. Allows or denies access based on these checks

Super admins can bypass feature flag checks for debugging purposes.

### Endpoint Permission Mapping

The middleware uses a regex-based mapping to determine which permission is required for each endpoint:

```python
ENDPOINT_PERMISSIONS = {
    r"GET /api/v[12]/admin/users.*": "view_users",
    r"POST /api/v[12]/admin/users.*": "manage_users",
    # ... more mappings
}
```

## JWT Authentication

JWT authentication (`src/auth/jwt_auth.py`) provides:

- Token creation and validation
- User identification
- Integration with the permission system

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Role

```python
from src.services.rbac.rbac_service import RbacService

async def create_admin_role(session, tenant_id):
    permission_ids = ["perm1", "perm2", "perm3"]  # IDs of admin permissions
    return await RbacService.create_role(
        session,
        "admin",
        "Administrator with full access",
        tenant_id,
        permission_ids
    )
```

### Assigning a Role to a User

```python
from src.services.rbac.rbac_service import RbacService

async def make_user_admin(session, user_id, role_id, tenant_id):
    return await RbacService.assign_role_to_user(
        session,
        user_id,
        role_id,
        tenant_id
    )
```

### Enabling a Feature for a Tenant

```python
from src.services.rbac.feature_service import FeatureService

async def enable_batch_processing(session, tenant_id):
    return await FeatureService.set_feature_status(
        session,
        "batch_processing",
        tenant_id,
        True
    )
```

### Creating a Protected Endpoint

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from src.auth.dependencies import get_required_user_id, get_tenant_id
from src.session.async_session import get_session

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/admin/users")
async def get_users(
    user_id: str = Depends(get_required_user_id),
    tenant_id: str = Depends(get_tenant_id),
    session = Depends(get_session)
):
    # This endpoint requires the "view_users" permission
    # The permission middleware will handle the check
    # ...
    return {"users": []}
```

## Testing

The RBAC implementation includes comprehensive tests:

- `tests/services/rbac/test_rbac_service.py`: Tests for the RBAC service
- `tests/services/rbac/test_feature_service.py`: Tests for the Feature service
- `tests/middleware/test_permission_middleware.py`: Tests for the Permission middleware
- `tests/db/test_rbac_schema.py`: Tests for the database schema integrity

## Best Practices

1. **Define Granular Permissions**: Create specific permissions for different actions rather than broad permissions.
2. **Use Role Hierarchies**: Create role hierarchies where higher-level roles inherit permissions from lower-level roles.
3. **Regularly Audit Permissions**: Regularly review and audit role-permission assignments.
4. **Cache Permission Checks**: The RBAC service caches permission checks to improve performance.
5. **Test Permission Changes**: Always test permission changes thoroughly to avoid unintended access restrictions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized**: The user is not authenticated. Check JWT token.
2. **403 Forbidden**: The user is authenticated but lacks the required permission.
3. **Feature Not Enabled**: The required feature is not enabled for the tenant.

### Debugging

1. Check the user's assigned roles and permissions in the database.
2. Verify that the endpoint is correctly mapped in the `ENDPOINT_PERMISSIONS` dictionary.
3. Check if the required feature is enabled for the tenant.
4. Use a super admin account to bypass feature flag checks for debugging.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Permission Groups**: Group related permissions for easier management.
2. **Time-Based Access Control**: Add time restrictions to roles and permissions.
3. **Delegation**: Allow users to delegate their permissions to other users.
4. **Approval Workflows**: Implement approval workflows for sensitive operations.
5. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging for permission changes.

## Conclusion

The RBAC implementation provides a flexible and secure way to control access to the application's resources. By properly configuring roles, permissions, and feature flags, you can ensure that users only have access to the resources they need.
