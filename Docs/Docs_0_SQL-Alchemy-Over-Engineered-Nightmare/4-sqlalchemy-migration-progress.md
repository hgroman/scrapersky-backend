# SQLAlchemy Migration Progress Report

## Completed Milestones

We've successfully implemented several critical components of the SQLAlchemy migration:

### 1. Core Infrastructure

- ✅ Created `src/db/engine.py` with properly configured async connection pooling
- ✅ Implemented `src/db/session.py` with async session management
- ✅ Set up `src/models/base.py` with BaseModel and common fields

### 2. SQLAlchemy Models

- ✅ Implemented Domain model with proper relationships
- ✅ Implemented Job model with proper relationships
- ✅ Resolved naming conflicts (renamed `metadata` to `domain_metadata`/`job_metadata`)
- ✅ Added proper serialization methods (`to_dict()`)

### 3. Service Layer

- ✅ Created DomainService for CRUD operations
- ✅ Created JobService for CRUD operations
- ✅ Implemented proper tenant isolation in both services

### 4. Database Migrations

- ✅ Set up Alembic for migration management
- ✅ Created initial migration to add new columns
- ✅ Added UUID columns for future compatibility
- ✅ Successfully migrated data to new UUID columns where possible

## Implementation Challenges Resolved

During the SQLAlchemy implementation, we encountered and resolved several challenges:

1. **Naming Conflicts**: Resolved the conflict with SQLAlchemy's reserved `metadata` attribute by renaming to `domain_metadata` and `job_metadata`.

2. **Data Type Conversions**: Handled non-UUID values in existing data by:

   - Adding parallel UUID columns instead of converting existing ones
   - Creating a data migration to populate UUID values where possible
   - Maintaining backward compatibility with existing non-UUID values

3. **Alembic Configuration**: Successfully configured Alembic to work with our async SQLAlchemy setup by:
   - Using standard PostgreSQL driver for migrations
   - Properly importing models to detect schema changes
   - Setting up migration scripts to avoid dependency issues with existing tables

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Endpoints (In Order)

- [ ] Convert sitemap_scraper.py to use SQLAlchemy

  - Replace direct database access with service layer calls
  - Update response handling to use model serialization
  - Test endpoint thoroughly

- [ ] Update remaining endpoints one-by-one:
  - places_scraper.py
  - domain_endpoints.py
  - job_endpoints.py
  - (Other scrapers and endpoints)

### 2. Finalize Migration

- [ ] Remove old database connection code
- [ ] Update tests to use SQLAlchemy
- [ ] Verify all functionality works with new implementation
- [ ] Document new database access patterns

### 3. Future Improvements

- [ ] Consider fully migrating to UUID primary keys
- [ ] Add additional indices for performance
- [ ] Implement more relationships between models
- [ ] Use SQLAlchemy features for more complex queries

## Lessons Learned

1. **Database Schema Evolution**: The migration demonstrated how to safely evolve a database schema without breaking existing functionality by:

   - Adding new columns instead of changing existing ones
   - Creating parallel data structures for compatibility
   - Using migrations to manage changes incrementally

2. **Async SQLAlchemy**: The implementation highlighted the importance of:

   - Proper async session management
   - Connection pooling configuration
   - Handling the differences between sync and async operations

3. **Alembic for Migrations**: Successfully used Alembic to:
   - Generate migration scripts
   - Apply schema changes safely
   - Handle data migrations for existing records

## Immediate Action Items

1. Identify the first endpoint to update (sitemap_scraper.py)
2. Create a branch for the endpoint conversion
3. Update the endpoint to use SQLAlchemy services
4. Test the updated endpoint
5. Continue with remaining endpoints
