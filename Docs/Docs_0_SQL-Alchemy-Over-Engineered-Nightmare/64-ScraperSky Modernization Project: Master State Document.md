# ScraperSky Modernization Project: Master State Document

## Executive Summary

The ScraperSky backend modernization project is currently in its final phase, focusing on the implementation and integration of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. The project has successfully transitioned from a legacy architecture with raw SQL queries to a modern SQLAlchemy ORM-based system with standardized services, router factory patterns, and dual API versioning with truthful naming conventions.

The project is approximately 92% complete, with the core database layer, service architecture, and most router modernization completed. The current focus is on finalizing the RBAC implementation, which will provide comprehensive security and feature management capabilities across the application.

## Project Journey and Milestones

### Phase 1: SQLAlchemy Integration (Completed)

- Resolved connection configuration issues with Supabase

### Phase 2: Service Standardization (Completed)

- Created domain-specific service organization
- Implemented service interfaces with consistent patterns
- Segregated business logic from API routes
- Moved database operations to appropriate services

### Phase 3: Router Modernization (Completed for core components)

- Implemented router factory pattern for standardized endpoints
- Created dual API versioning (v1/v2) with truthful naming
- Applied consistent error handling across all endpoints

## Technical Architecture

### Service Organization

Services are organized into domain-specific directories:

```
src/
  services/
    core/
      auth_service.py
      validation_service.py
      error_service.py
    rbac/
      rbac_service.py
      feature_service.py
    sitemap/
      processing_service.py
      metadata_service.py
    google_maps_api/
      search_service.py
      details_service.py
```

### Router Factory Pattern

The router factory creates standardized routes with consistent error handling:

```python
class RouterFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_get_route(
        router: APIRouter,
        path: str,
        endpoint: Callable,
        response_model: Type[Any] = None,
        ...
    ) -> None:
        # Standardized route creation
```

### API Versioning Strategy

Dual versioning with truthful naming:

```python
# Legacy route (v1)
@router.get("/api/v1/places/search")
async def search_places():
    # Implementation

# Truthful naming route (v2)
@router.get("/api/v2/google_maps_api/search")
async def search_places():
    # Same implementation
```

### Database Connection

Optimized for Supabase's Supavisor connection pooler:

```python
engine = create_async_engine(
    DATABASE_URL,
    pool_size=5 if IS_DEVELOPMENT else settings.db_max_pool_size,
    max_overflow=5 if IS_DEVELOPMENT else 10,
    pool_timeout=settings.db_connection_timeout,
    pool_recycle=1800,
    connect_args=connect_args
)
```

## Critical Knowledge Transfer for Next Phase

### 1. Development Environment

- Environment variables in `.env` file (DO NOT MODIFY)
- Development mode uses `scraper_sky_2024` token
- Docker setup in `docker-compose.yml`

### 2. Database Knowledge

- Some tables use UUID, others use SERIAL
- Tenant isolation must be maintained
- Feature flags affect permission checks
- Role hierarchy must be preserved

### 3. Implementation Patterns

- All services follow domain-specific organization
- Router factory used for all endpoint creation
- Dual versioning (v1/v2) with truthful naming
- SQLAlchemy models for all database entities

### 4. Authentication Flow

- Development mode bypasses some checks
- Production requires proper JWT
- Tenant context is required
- User permissions cascade through roles

## Next Steps for Project Continuation

1. **Execute RBAC Sample Data Population**:

   - Run `populate_rbac_sample_data.py` with appropriate precautions
   - Verify data integrity and relationships
   - Document any issues encountered

2. **Complete RBAC Dashboard Testing**:

   - Test all dashboard functionality
   - Verify integration with API endpoints
   - Document any UI/UX issues

3. **Implement Missing API Endpoints**:

   - Complete any remaining RBAC API endpoints
   - Ensure consistent error handling
   - Validate authentication and authorization

4. **Docker Implementation**:

   - Complete Docker container setup
   - Test multi-container deployment
   - Verify environment variable handling

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for RBAC operations
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for user workflows

## Known Issues and Gotchas

1. **Environment Handling**:

   - DO NOT modify the `.env` file
   - All new environment variables must be added to `env.template`
   - Development mode uses `scraper_sky_2024` token

2. **Code Modification Rules**:

   - PRESERVE all existing comments
   - DO NOT destructively edit documentation
   - CHECK file existence before creation
   - MAINTAIN existing error handling
   - FOLLOW established naming conventions

3. **Database Constraints**:
   - Some tables use UUID, others use SERIAL
   - Tenant isolation must be maintained
   - Feature flags affect permission checks
   - Role hierarchy must be preserved

## Conclusion

The ScraperSky modernization project has successfully transformed a legacy codebase with direct SQL operations into a modern, maintainable architecture with SQLAlchemy ORM, standardized services, and consistent API patterns. The project is now in its final phase, focusing on the implementation and integration of the RBAC system.

The key aspects for continuing the project are understanding the RBAC database structure, the service organization patterns, the router factory implementation, and the API versioning strategy. With these foundations in place, the remaining tasks involve finalizing the RBAC implementation, completing the Docker setup, and conducting comprehensive testing.

The established patterns and architecture provide a solid foundation for future development and maintenance, ensuring a robust, scalable, and secure application.
