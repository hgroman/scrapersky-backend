# ScraperSky Backend Engineering Document #18: Service Standardization and SQLAlchemy Integration Action Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive action plan for standardizing the ScraperSky backend service architecture and ensuring complete SQLAlchemy integration across all services. Building on our previous modernization work (Documents #1-17), we'll focus on creating a consistent service layer that properly leverages our SQLAlchemy foundation.

The plan addresses the current architectural inconsistencies, where services are scattered across multiple directories without a clear organizational principle. By systematically analyzing, categorizing, and standardizing these services, we'll create a more maintainable codebase that fully realizes the benefits of our SQLAlchemy migration.

## 2. Current Context and Challenges

### 2.1 Modernization Progress (65% Complete)

Our SQLAlchemy modernization project has made significant progress:

- **Database Layer (90% Complete)**: Successfully migrated from direct SQL to SQLAlchemy ORM, fixed ID type mismatches, and optimized Supabase connections
- **Service Layer (70% Complete)**: Updated several services to use SQLAlchemy, but with inconsistent patterns and organization
- **Route Modernization (40% Complete)**: Partially migrated sitemap_scraper.py, but with remaining linter errors and inconsistent service usage

### 2.2 Architectural Inconsistency

We've identified a critical architectural issue: services are spread across multiple directories without a clear organizational pattern:

- `/src/services/` - Contains some services directly at the root level
- `/src/services/core/` - Contains auth_service.py, job_service.py
- `/src/services/batch/` - Contains batch_processor_service.py
- `/src/services/error/` - May contain error handling services
- `/src/services/job/` - May contain job-related services
- `/src/services/validation/` - May contain validation services
- `/src/services/new/` - May contain newer service implementations

This inconsistency makes the codebase harder to navigate, impedes the proper use of services from routes, and complicates future maintenance.

### 2.3 Priority Services

Based on previous analysis, we've identified the following priority services for standardization:

1. **db_service** - Foundation for database access
2. **batch_processor_service** - Critical for handling concurrent operations
3. **job_manager_service** - Essential for tracking background job status
4. **auth_service** - Important for security and multi-tenancy

## 3. Action Plan: Today's Work

### 3.1 Step 1: Create Service Inventory Matrix (2 hours)

We'll create a comprehensive inventory of all services to understand their current state and dependencies.

#### 3.1.1 Inventory Process

1. **Directory Scanning**: Examine all `/src/services/` directories and subdirectories to identify services
2. **Service Identification**: For each service file:
   - Document its current location
   - Identify its primary purpose
   - Note whether it uses SQLAlchemy or direct SQL
   - Check for static vs. instance-based implementation

#### 3.1.2 Dependency Mapping

1. **Import Analysis**: Examine imports to identify dependencies between services
2. **Route Usage**: Document which routes import and use each service
3. **Create Dependency Graph**: Visualize dependencies to identify critical services

#### 3.1.3 Matrix Structure

Create a structured matrix with the following columns:

| Service Name | Current Location    | Purpose        | SQLAlchemy Status | Implementation Type | Used By         | Depends On | Priority | Required Changes                 |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| auth_service | /src/services/core/ | Authentication | Partial           | Class-based         | Multiple routes | db_service | High     | Update to use SQLAlchemy session |

#### 3.1.4 Deliverable

A comprehensive matrix document that provides a complete view of all services and their current state, serving as the foundation for the rest of our work.

### 3.2 Step 2: Analyze sitemap_scraper.py Service Usage (2 hours)

Since sitemap_scraper.py is a focal point of our modernization efforts, we'll perform a detailed analysis of its service usage patterns.

#### 3.2.1 Analysis Process

1. **Service Import Analysis**: Document all services imported and how they're used
2. **Direct Database Access**: Identify places that bypass services with direct database operations
3. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Note where similar operations use different approaches
4. **SQLAlchemy Usage**: Analyze how SQLAlchemy sessions are managed

#### 3.2.2 Linter Error Categorization

Document all linter errors and categorize them:

- Indentation issues
- Unbound variables
- Improper conditionals
- Missing return statements
- Import issues

#### 3.2.3 Function Analysis

For each major function in sitemap_scraper.py:

1. Document its purpose
2. Identify which services it uses
3. Note any direct database access
4. Describe how it should be refactored

#### 3.2.4 Deliverable

A detailed analysis document with specific recommendations for standardizing service usage in sitemap_scraper.py, including concrete examples of refactoring patterns.

### 3.3 Step 3: Plan Service Migration Sequence (2 hours)

Based on our inventory and analysis, we'll create a systematic plan for migrating and standardizing services.

#### 3.3.1 Architecture Decision

Decide on the target architecture for services:

- **Option A**: Flat structure (all services in root directory)
- **Option B**: Modular structure (services organized by domain)
- **Option C**: Hybrid structure (core services in one location, domain services in subfolders)

Based on previous indications, we'll likely choose **Option B: Modular structure** as it aligns with the project's direction.

#### 3.3.2 Migration Planning

For each service, document:

1. **Current State**: Location, implementation pattern, SQLAlchemy usage
2. **Target State**: Desired location, implementation pattern, SQLAlchemy integration
3. **Required Changes**: Code updates, import changes, interface standardization
4. **Dependent Updates**: Files that need updating when the service changes
5. **Migration Order**: Sequence for updating to avoid breaking dependencies

#### 3.3.3 Core Service Focus

Detail specific migration plans for the four priority services:

1. db_service
2. batch_processor_service
3. job_manager_service
4. auth_service

#### 3.3.4 Deliverable

A sequential migration plan document with clear steps for each service, ordered to minimize disruption and ensure dependencies are maintained.

### 3.4 Step 4: Service Interface Standardization (2 hours)

Define consistent interfaces and patterns for standardized services to ensure they are easy to use correctly from routes.

#### 3.4.1 Interface Templates

Create standardized templates for different types of services:

- **Data Access Services**: Standard CRUD operations
- **Authentication Services**: User validation, permission checking
- **Processing Services**: Background task management, concurrency control
- **Utility Services**: Common operations and helpers

#### 3.4.2 SQLAlchemy Integration Patterns

Document standard patterns for SQLAlchemy usage:

- Session management
- Transaction boundaries
- Error handling
- Tenant isolation

#### 3.4.3 Example Implementation

Provide concrete examples of properly implemented services using SQLAlchemy:

- Class structure
- Method signatures
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation requirements

#### 3.4.4 Usage Guidelines

Document best practices for using services from routes:

- Dependency injection
- Error handling
- Transaction management
- Tenant isolation

#### 3.4.5 Deliverable

A comprehensive service standards document that defines how services should be implemented and used throughout the application.
