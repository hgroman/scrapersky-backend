Now that we have all the necessary documentation, implementation details, and the history of interactions with Cursor, letâ€™s take a step back and organize everything into a **clear and structured project alignment document**. This will serve as both an **assumptions and requirements document** and a **project roadmap** for development moving forward.

## **RBAC Sidebar Features - Assumptions, Requirements, and Implementation Roadmap**

### **1. Overview**

The **RBAC Sidebar Feature Management System** is designed to provide role-based access control (RBAC) for UI sidebar features in a **multi-tenant SaaS environment**. The backend is built using **FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Supabase**, with frontend integration planned via **Lovable.dev**.

The primary goal is to **ensure secure and granular access control**, allowing different user roles to see and interact with features based on permissions, while keeping the architecture **modular, extendable, and efficient**.

---

### **2. Assumptions**

The following assumptions must hold for this system to work as intended:

1. **Database and ORM Usage**

   - SQLAlchemy **is the exclusive ORM** for database interactions (no raw SQL unless explicitly required).
   - The **sidebar_features** table **must** be correctly linked to feature flags and tenant configurations.

2. **RBAC Enforcement**

   - User permissions are retrieved via `RBAC Service` and enforced at the API middleware level.
   - **Super Admins bypass permission checks** for debugging/admin purposes.
   - Permissions are **mapped at the endpoint level** via middleware and enforced for feature access.

3. **API and Data Flow**

   - All **FastAPI endpoints are versioned** under `/api/v2/role_based_access_control/`.
   - Sidebar features are fetched via `feature_service.get_sidebar_features()`, which:
     - **Checks tenant feature enablement** (`tenant_features`).
     - **Filters based on user permissions** (`requires_permission`).
     - **Orders features** based on `display_order`.

4. **Frontend Considerations**
   - Sidebar **is dynamic** and populated via API requests.
   - Feature access logic is handled **in the backend**, reducing frontend complexity.
   - Frontend will use **React (via Lovable.dev)** and must integrate authentication & RBAC.

---

### **3. System Components & Dependencies**

#### **Backend Components**

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with user roles.
- **RBAC Service**: Manages roles, permissions, and feature access.
- **Feature Service**: Handles sidebar feature configuration.
- **Permission Middleware**: Intercepts API calls and enforces access control.

#### **Database Schema (Relevant Tables)**

| Table Name         | Purpose                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `feature_flags`    | Stores all system-wide features      |
| `tenant_features`  | Tracks feature enablement per tenant |
| `sidebar_features` | Defines UI sidebar structure         |
| `roles`            | Defines user roles                   |
| `permissions`      | Stores permission definitions        |
| `role_permissions` | Maps roles to permissions            |
| `user_roles`       | Assigns roles to users               |

---

### **4. Implementation Roadmap**

The following steps ensure a structured and efficient development process:

#### âœ… **Phase 1 - Database and API Foundation (COMPLETE)**

- [x] Define SQLAlchemy models (`feature_flags`, `tenant_features`, `sidebar_features`).
- [x] Implement API endpoints under `rbac_router.py`.
- [x] Implement `get_sidebar_features()` with **tenant & permission filtering**.
- [x] Validate database integrity and schema consistency.

#### ðŸš€ **Phase 2 - Implement Role-Based Sidebar Access (IN PROGRESS)**

- [ ] Ensure **`requires_permission`** is properly added to `sidebar_features`.
- [ ] Update **`get_sidebar_features()`** to enforce RBAC filtering.
- [ ] Validate API responses for different **user roles (Admin, User, Super Admin)**.
- [ ] Ensure proper **error handling and debugging tools**.

#### ðŸ”œ **Phase 3 - Frontend Integration & UI Development**

- [ ] Deploy API to **GetHub** and ensure stability.
- [ ] Provide **API documentation** for frontend developers.
- [ ] Develop React **sidebar UI components**.
- [ ] Implement frontend role-based **hiding/showing of sidebar items**.

#### ðŸ›  **Phase 4 - Optimization and Security**

- [ ] Implement **caching for permission checks** (Redis?).
- [ ] Enable **detailed audit logging** for role/feature changes.
- [ ] Ensure **performance optimizations** (DB indexing, API response times).
- [ ] Conduct **security review** (XSS, CSRF, JWT token handling).

### **5. Open Questions / Next Steps**

1. **Tenant Model Issue**

   - Cursor flagged a **missing `Tenant` model** in `rbac.py`. However, the `tenants` table **exists in the database**.
   - Should we **explicitly define** the `Tenant` model in SQLAlchemy, or keep it managed externally?

2. **Requires_Permission Column**

   - The column **already exists** in `sidebar_features`, but Cursor **keeps attempting to re-add it**.
   - Next step: **Ensure migration history is clean** and update only the filtering logic.

3. **Frontend API Contract**
   - How will Lovable.dev structure UI state management for sidebar features?
   - Should the frontend request **full sidebar data** and filter locally, or rely entirely on backend filtering?

## **Conclusion**

This document ensures **continuity, clarity, and efficiency** in our development process. If we ever restart a conversation or need to onboard a new developer, this will **immediately provide project alignment**.
