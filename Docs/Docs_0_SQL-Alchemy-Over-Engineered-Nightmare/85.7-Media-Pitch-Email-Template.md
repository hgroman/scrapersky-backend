## Email Body:

Dear [Journalist Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Given your excellent coverage of [reference relevant article they wrote about marketing technology/business intelligence/competitive analysis], I wanted to personally reach out about a new product launch that might interest your readers.

Last Apple has just launched ScraperSky, an invitation-only digital intelligence platform that transforms disconnected data streams into strategic business insights. As businesses struggle with increasingly fragmented data sources, ScraperSky provides a unified ecosystem of eight proprietary tools that extract actionable intelligence from previously siloed information.

**Why ScraperSky matters:**

- It consolidates multiple intelligence streams that businesses typically access through separate, disconnected tools
- The platform's exclusive, invitation-only model ensures personalized onboarding and priority feature development
- Built with a modern technology stack (FastAPI backend, React frontend), it delivers enterprise-grade security with exceptional user experience

I'd be happy to provide you with:

- An exclusive demo of the platform
- In-depth interviews about how businesses are using digital intelligence
- Access to the complete press kit with all information about ScraperSky
- Custom insights on trends in the digital intelligence space

Our full press release is available at: [scrapersky.com/scrapersky-platform-launch](https://scrapersky.com/scrapersky-platform-launch)

Would you be interested in covering this launch? I'm available for a call or to answer any questions via email at your convenience.

Thank you for your consideration,
