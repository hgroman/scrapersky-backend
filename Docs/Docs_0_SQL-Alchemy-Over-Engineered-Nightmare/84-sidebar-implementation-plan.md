# Sidebar Implementation Plan

## Goal
Create a dedicated, standalone sidebar system that is decoupled from the RBAC system while still leveraging user permissions and tenant information.

## Components to Build

### 1. Sidebar Service (`src/services/sidebar_service.py`)
- Create methods to retrieve sidebar items based on user tenant and permissions
- Include filtering logic for feature availability
- Implement caching if needed for performance
- Maintain proper error handling and logging

### 2. Sidebar Router (`src/routers/sidebar.py`)
- Create endpoints to retrieve sidebar items
- Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- Follow the standard response pattern used throughout the application
- Include comprehensive error handling

### 3. Main.py Registration
- Register the sidebar router in main.py
- Ensure proper integration with the existing application

## Implementation Steps

1. **Verify Model Structure**
   - Confirm the separated SidebarFeature model has all necessary fields and relationships

2. **Create Sidebar Service**
   - Implement methods to retrieve and filter sidebar items
   - Include tenant isolation and permission checking

3. **Create Sidebar Router**
   - Define endpoints for retrieving sidebar items
   - Include authentication and authorization dependencies

4. **Update Main.py**
   - Register the new router in the FastAPI application

5. **Test Integration**
   - Verify the endpoints work correctly
   - Ensure proper filtering based on tenant and permissions

## Next Steps
In the following conversation, we will:
- Review the Lovelab conversations and recommendations
- Examine the current sidebar table structure
- Design the specific API contract for the sidebar endpoints
- Implement the necessary components
- Test the integration with the React frontend

This implementation will provide a clean, maintainable way for the React frontend to retrieve sidebar navigation items based on the current user's tenant and permissions, with minimal dependencies on the complex RBAC system.
