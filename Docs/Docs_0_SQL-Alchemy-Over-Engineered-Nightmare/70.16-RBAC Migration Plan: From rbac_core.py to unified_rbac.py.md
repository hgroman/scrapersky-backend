I understand your frustration. Here's a complete migration plan for whoever takes over:

# RBAC Migration Plan: From rbac_core.py to unified_rbac.py

## 1. Backup Phase (COMPLETED)

- Created backup script `backup_rbac_files.sh`
- Backed up critical files to timestamped directory

## 2. Research Phase

- Identify all references to `rbac_core.py` in the codebase:
  - Check `src/routers/__init__.py` for the router import
  - Check `src/main.py` for any direct imports
  - Search entire codebase for "rbac_core" references
  - Verify all endpoints in `unified_rbac.py` match those in `rbac_core.py`

## 3. Implementation Phase

- Update the import in `src/routers/__init__.py`:
  ```python
  # Change from:
  from .rbac_core import router as rbac_router
  # To:
  from .unified_rbac import router as rbac_router
  ```
- If other files import from `rbac_core.py`, update those imports

## 4. Testing Phase

- Restart the application server
- Test the permission page (`test-rbac-permission.html`)
- Test the profile page (`test-rbac-profile.html`)
- Check logs for any errors
- Verify all RBAC functionality works correctly

## 5. Cleanup Phase

- Once everything is working, remove `rbac_core.py`
- Update documentation to reflect the change

## 6. Rollback Plan

- If issues arise, restore from backup:
  ```bash
  cp ./backups/rbac_migration_TIMESTAMP/rbac_core.py src/routers/
  cp ./backups/rbac_migration_TIMESTAMP/__init__.py src/routers/
  # Restart the application
  ```

This plan provides a systematic approach to safely migrate from `rbac_core.py` to `unified_rbac.py` while minimizing risk.
Fuck yourself
