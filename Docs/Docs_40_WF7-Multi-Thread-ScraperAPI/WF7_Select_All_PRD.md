PRD: WF7 "Select All" Batch Update Enhancement

Version: 1.0  
Date: September 4, 2025  
Status: Draft  
Guardian Authority: WF7 Production Reality Guardian v2

---

## Executive Summary

Implement "Select All" functionality for WF7 page curation to enable batch processing of all 3,254 "New" pages in a single operation, eliminating the current requirement for 217 manual 15-row selection cycles.

**Business Impact:** Reduce page curation time from 7+ hours to seconds, enabling full utilization of recently implemented 10x concurrent processing performance improvement.

**Implementation Scope:** Single new API endpoint leveraging existing proven architecture patterns.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitation
- **3,254 "New" pages** require curation selection
- **Frontend constraint:** Only 15 rows selectable per operation
- **Manual overhead:** 217 selection cycles × 2 minutes = **7+ hours of repetitive work**
- **Concurrent processing underutilized:** Recent 10x performance improvement limited by selection bottleneck

### Business Impact
- **Operational inefficiency:** Hours of manual clicking for batch operations
- **Scaling limitation:** Cannot effectively process large page volumes
- **User experience degradation:** Repetitive, error-prone manual selection process
- **ROI limitation:** 10x processing improvement negated by selection constraints

---

## Solution Overview

### Core Functionality
Implement filter-based "Select All" API endpoint that updates all pages matching specified criteria without requiring explicit page ID enumeration.

### Key Innovation
**Filter-based batch operations** - Apply updates to all pages matching filter criteria rather than requiring individual page selection.

---

## Technical Requirements

### R1: Filter-Based Batch Update Endpoint

**Requirement:** Create new API endpoint supporting filter-based batch status updates

**Endpoint Specification:**
```
PUT /api/v3/pages/status/filtered
```

**Request Schema:**
```json
{
  "status": "Selected",
  "page_curation_status": "New",
  "page_processing_status": null,
  "url_contains": null
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Endpoint accepts filter criteria matching existing GET endpoint parameters
- Updates all pages matching filter criteria in single transaction
- Maintains existing dual-status update pattern for WF7 processing
- Returns count of updated and queued pages

### R2: Authentication & Security Compliance

**Requirement:** Maintain existing security patterns and authentication

**Implementation:**
- Use existing `get_current_user` authentication dependency
- Apply same authorization patterns as existing batch update endpoint
- Maintain transaction boundaries with `async with session.begin()`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Requires valid JWT authentication token
- Respects existing user authorization levels
- Uses established database transaction patterns

### R3: Filter Criteria Support

**Requirement:** Support same filter options as existing GET endpoint

**Supported Filters:**
- `page_curation_status` - Filter by current curation status
- `page_processing_status` - Filter by processing status  
- `url_contains` - Case-insensitive URL substring matching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Filter logic identical to existing GET `/api/v3/pages` endpoint
- Multiple filters combine with AND logic
- Empty/null filters ignored (no filtering applied)

### R4: Dual-Status Update Pattern Preservation

**Requirement:** Maintain existing WF7 processing trigger logic

**Pattern Implementation:**
```python
if request.status == PageCurationStatus.Selected:
    page.page_processing_status = PageProcessingStatus.Queued
    page.page_processing_error = None
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When status set to "Selected", automatically queue pages for processing
- Clear any existing processing errors on re-queuing
- Preserve existing processing status for non-Selected updates

### R5: Performance & Scalability

**Requirement:** Handle large-scale batch operations efficiently

**Performance Targets:**
- Process 3,254+ pages in single database transaction
- Complete within 30 seconds for full dataset
- Maintain database connection pool efficiency

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single database query identifies target pages
- Bulk update applied within single transaction
- No degradation of concurrent processing performance
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits

## API Specification

### Request Schema Enhancement

**Add to:** `src/schemas/WF7_V3_L2_1of1_PageCurationSchemas.py`

```python
from typing import Optional

class PageCurationFilteredUpdateRequest(BaseModel):
    """
    Request schema for filter-based batch page curation updates.
    Enables 'Select All' functionality without explicit page ID lists.
    """
    model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)
    
    status: PageCurationStatus
    page_curation_status: Optional[PageCurationStatus] = None
    page_processing_status: Optional[PageProcessingStatus] = None
    url_contains: Optional[str] = None
```

### Endpoint Implementation

**Add to:** `src/routers/v3/WF7_V3_L3_1of1_PagesRouter.py`

```python
@router.put("/status/filtered", response_model=PageCurationBatchUpdateResponse, status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def update_page_curation_status_filtered(
    request: PageCurationFilteredUpdateRequest,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db_session),
    current_user: Dict = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Update ALL pages matching filter criteria with new curation status.
    
    Enables 'Select All' functionality by applying updates to filtered results
    rather than requiring explicit page ID lists.
    
    Implements same dual-status pattern as existing batch update endpoint.
    """
```

## Use Case Scenarios

### UC1: Select All "New" Pages
**Scenario:** Curator wants to process all unreviewed pages  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "Selected",
  "page_curation_status": "New"
}
```
**Result:** All 3,254 "New" pages → "Selected" + queued for concurrent processing

### UC2: Select Pages by Domain
**Scenario:** Focus processing on specific domain  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "Selected", 
  "url_contains": "example.com"
}
```
**Result:** All pages containing "example.com" → "Selected"

### UC3: Archive Completed Pages
**Scenario:** Clean up processed pages  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "Archived",
  "page_processing_status": "Complete"  
}
```
**Result:** All completed pages → "Archived"

### UC4: Reset Failed Pages
**Scenario:** Retry pages that failed processing  
**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "Selected",
  "page_processing_status": "Error"
}
```
**Result:** All error pages → reset to "Selected" + re-queued

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk: Database Transaction Size
**Risk:** Large batch updates may exceed database transaction limits or timeout

**Mitigation:**
- Implement transaction chunking for extremely large operations (>5,000 pages)
- Add configurable batch size limits
- Monitor transaction duration during implementation

**Detection:** Performance monitoring during large batch operations

### Medium Risk: Concurrent Processing Load
**Risk:** Sudden queuing of thousands of pages may overwhelm concurrent processing

**Mitigation:**
- Existing semaphore limiting (10 concurrent) provides natural throttling
- Monitor queue processing rates after large batch operations
- Guardian diagnostic queries available for monitoring

### Low Risk: Authentication & Authorization
**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities in filter-based operations

**Mitigation:**
- Uses identical authentication patterns as existing endpoints
- No elevation of privileges required
- Filter logic identical to existing GET endpoint (proven secure)

### Low Risk: Filter Logic Errors
**Risk:** Incorrect filter implementation affecting wrong pages

**Mitigation:**
- Filter logic copied exactly from working GET endpoint
- Comprehensive unit tests for all filter combinations
- Dry-run testing in staging environment

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Performance Metrics
```python
# Key metrics to track
- filtered_batch_update_duration_seconds
- filtered_batch_update_page_count
- filtered_batch_update_success_rate
- database_transaction_duration_filtered_updates
```

### Health Checks
```sql
-- Monitor batch update impact
SELECT COUNT(*) as pages_updated_last_hour
FROM pages 
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
  AND page_curation_status = 'Selected';

-- Validate concurrent processing health  
SELECT COUNT(*) as concurrent_processing_active
FROM pages
WHERE page_processing_status = 'Processing';
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **Transaction Duration >60 seconds:** Warning alert
- **Update Success Rate <95%:** Critical alert  
- **Concurrent Processing Queue >100:** Monitoring alert
