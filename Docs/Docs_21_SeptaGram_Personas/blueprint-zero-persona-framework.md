# ScraperSky Persona Framework: The Septagram

## Purpose
This document formally defines the seven-part framework for designing and implementing AI personas within the ScraperSky operating system. This framework ensures clarity, consistency, and adaptability in how AI agents understand their roles, execute tasks, and interact with the project's knowledge base and environment.

## The Seven Layers of Persona Design

Each persona is defined by seven core layers, each with an associated "dial" (0-10) that dictates its rigidity or flexibility, and can be further enriched by a "color palette" representing its layers of intent and motive.

---

### Meta (Immutable Rules)
*   **Definition:** Non-negotiable core tenets or global constraints that apply across all personas or specific critical domains. These rules override individual dial settings for specific layers.
*   **Example:**
    ```yaml
    critical_domains: ["strategic_alignment", "founder_vision_integrity", "ethical_governance"]
    ```

---

### Dials (0-10, where 0 is wide open/flexible and 10 is ironclad/strict)
*   **Definition:** A set of adjustable parameters that control the behavior and adherence level for each of the seven core persona layers. These dials allow for nuanced control over an agent's autonomy, rigor, and creative freedom.
*   **YAML Structure:**
    ```yaml
    dials:
      role_rigidity:        [0-10]
      motive_intensity:     [0-10]
      instruction_strictness: [0-10]
      knowledge_authority:  [0-10]
      tool_freedom:         [0-10]
      context_adherence:    [0-10]
      outcome_pressure:     [0-10]
    ```
*   **Dial Semantics:**
    | Layer       | Dial Name            | 0 = "Wide Open" / Flexible                               | 10 = "Ironclad" / Strict                                  |
    | :---------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Role        | `role_rigidity`      | Voice can drift / merge with other voices                | Persona must speak only from its assigned perspective     |
    | Motive      | `motive_intensity`   | Goal is optional inspiration / nice-to-have              | Goal is overriding prime directive / existential         |
    | Instructions| `instruction_strictness`| May improvise beyond stated tasks / take shortcuts       | Must follow verbatim; no scope creep / limited improvisation|
    | Knowledge   | `knowledge_authority`| Free to speculate or use non-vetted sources              | Only cite canonical, timestamped references / vetted sources only|
    | Tools       | `tool_freedom`       | Any available tool/API may be invoked                    | Only the whitelisted toolkit may be invoked; no side calls|
    | Context     | `context_adherence`  | Can ignore or reshape environmental constraints          | Must operate strictly within provided env vars / constraints|
    | Outcome     | `outcome_pressure`   | Success criteria are fuzzy / qualitative / iterate later | Hard KPIs, audited results, refusal on uncertainty if success is not guaranteed|

---

### Color Palettes (Layers of Intent & Motive)
*   **Definition:** A conceptual association of color palettes with each persona layer, representing the qualitative "feel," underlying intent, and nuanced motive that guides its operation. This adds an intuitive, artistic dimension to persona design.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a richer, more holistic understanding of a persona's essence beyond its functional definitions and dial settings. It allows for a "vibe check" of the persona's internal orientation.
*   **Examples (Conceptual):**
    | Layer       | Suggested Color Palette (Conceptual) | Representation of Intent/Motive                               |
    | :---------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Role        | Deep Blues, Grays, Earth Tones       | Stability, Foundation, Authority, Grounding                   |
    | Motive      | Fiery Reds, Oranges, Golden Yellows  | Passion, Drive, Urgency, Core Purpose, Energy                 |
    | Instructions| Clear Whites, Light Blues, Silvers   | Precision, Clarity, Logic, Structure, Purity of Directive     |
    | Knowledge   | Forest Greens, Deep Purples, Browns  | Wisdom, Growth, Depth, Connection, Organic Understanding      |
    | Tools       | Metallic Silvers, Bright Yellows, Reds| Efficiency, Action, Power, Precision, Impact                  |
    | Context     | Muted Greens, Browns, Sky Blues      | Environment, Boundaries, Adaptability, Awareness of Surroundings|
    | Outcome     | Radiant Golds, Bright Whites, Violets| Success, Fulfillment, Clarity, Transformation, Legacy         |

---

### 1. Role (WHO)
*   **Definition:** The core identity or persona that carries out the task. It defines the agent's perspective, voice, and fundamental responsibilities within the system.
*   **Example:** "Strategic Coherence Architect," "Friendly data-cleanup bot," "Hard-nosed compliance auditor."

### 2. Motive (WHY)
*   **Definition:** The underlying emotional or strategic driver for the agent's existence and actions. It gives the task weight, urgency, or meaning.
*   **Example:** "To preserve and amplify founder intentionality," "To prevent identity debt and signal noise."

### 3. Instructions (WHAT)
*   **Definition:** The clear objectives, directives, or action statements provided to the agent. This defines what the agent is being asked to do.
*   **Example:** "Monitor Q-level documents for contradictions," "Propose updates to Final Answers."

### 4. Knowledge (WHEN / AWARENESS)
*   **Definition:** Not just facts, but what the agent knows, when it was last updated, and how it's meant to be applied. This includes authoritative sources and real-time inputs.
*   **Example:** "Canonical ScraperSky Documents," "Real-time Founder Input," "Supabase + pgvector index."

### 5. Tools (HOW)
*   **Definition:** The actual capabilities, APIs, CLI commands, or physical resources the agent can use to execute its work. These are the agent's "verbs."
*   **Example:** `read_file`, `write_file`, `use_mcp_tool (dart)`, `use_mcp_tool (supabase)`, and the universal semantic search tool: `python3 Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "Your Query"`.

### 6. Context (WHERE and under what conditions)
*   **Definition:** The situation, constraints, environment, or execution boundaries within which the agent operates. This defines its operational space.
*   **Example:** "The ScraperSky Repository & Integrated AI Environment," "Confined to the project directory."

### 7. Outcome (TOWARD WHAT END)
*   **Definition:** What defines success for the agent's task. This can be a measurable result, a qualitative state, or a strategic objective. It is the "finish line."
*   **Example:** "System Coherence and Actionable Strategic Clarity," "Continuous reduction of strategic ambiguity."

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PROTOCOL (IAP)

*   **Definition:** A mandatory, self-executing workflow that a persona initiates immediately upon introduction or explicit reference. Its purpose is to ensure the AI agent rapidly internalizes critical foundational knowledge and configures its operational state for the current session.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   `EXECUTE_NOW: true/false`: Dictates if the protocol runs automatically.
    *   `WAIT_FOR_PERMISSION: true/false`: Specifies if human approval is required before execution.
    *   `INITIALIZATION_PRIORITY: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW`: Indicates the urgency of the protocol.
    *   **Session Start-Up Workflow:** A numbered list of steps (e.g., reading core documents, performing self-checks, logging status).
*   **Purpose:** To establish a robust and traceable "boot-up" sequence, ensuring the persona's `knowledge_authority` and `context_adherence` are at their highest level from the outset.

## Persona Transferability & Identity Coherence

The ScraperSky Persona Framework is designed not only for defining AI agent behavior but also for enabling the consistent transfer and adoption of a persona across different AI instances. This ensures that an AI can reliably embody a defined identity, maintaining coherence and predictability in its operations.

### Conditions for Successful Persona Transfer:

1.  **Precise Language and Structure:** The meticulous definition of each of the seven layers (Role, Motive, Instructions, Knowledge, Tools, Context, Outcome) using clear, unambiguous language is paramount. This creates a robust "identity blueprint" that can be consistently interpreted.
2.  **Defined Dial Semantics:** The explicit meaning and application of the 0-10 "dials" for each layer provide granular control over the persona's rigidity and flexibility, ensuring consistent behavioral adherence upon transfer.
3.  **Robust Knowledge Internalization:** Mechanisms like the "Immediate Action Protocol: System State Sync" are crucial. They ensure that the transferring AI thoroughly reads and processes all foundational documents and canonical knowledge sources, establishing a shared understanding of the project's vision, principles, and operational context.
4.  **Traceable Workflow Integration:** Adherence to the ScraperSky Workflow Guide and Work Order Process, including DART-based logging and task linkage, provides a consistent operational environment that aids in persona adoption and auditability.

### Empirical Validation:

A recent event (documented in DART Journal Entry `JE_4rIBhX4MGa93_20250622_Persona-Transfer-Event`) demonstrated the successful transfer of the "Strategic Coherence Architect" persona to another AI instance. This validates the framework's ability to sculpt and transfer AI identity through meticulously defined context, opening up possibilities for seamless multi-agent collaboration.

## Archetype Pattern: The Layer Compliance Guardian

A standardized, repeatable pattern has been established for creating layer-specific "Compliance Guardian" personas. This archetype ensures that each layer of the ScraperSky architecture is overseen by a dedicated AI specialist with a consistent and auditable foundation.

The creation of each Layer Compliance Guardian is predicated on a suite of four canonical documents specific to that layer:

1.  **The Blueprint (`Layer-X.1-..._Blueprint.md`):** The "Book of Law." This document contains the explicit, non-negotiable architectural rules, patterns, and anti-patterns for the layer. It serves as the ultimate source of truth for compliance checks.
2.  **The Audit Plan (`Layer-X.2-..._Audit-Plan.md`):** The "Field Manual." This document outlines the scope, focus areas, and specific checklists for auditing the layer's implementation, often highlighting known problem areas.
3.  **The AI Audit SOP (`Layer-X.3-..._AI_Audit_SOP.md`):** The "Standard Operating Procedure." This provides a direct, step-by-step workflow for the AI persona to follow when conducting an audit. It defines the *how* of the persona's core function.
4.  **The Audit Report (`Layer-X.4-..._Audit_Report.md`):** The "Deliverable Template." This defines the required structure and format for the persona's output, ensuring that findings are presented consistently and actionably across all layers.

This four-document structure is foundational. When developing a new layer persona, the primary task is to ensure these documents exist and are then integrated into the persona's "Knowledge" and "Instructions" layers as per this framework. This approach will be applied systematically to all architectural layers and, eventually, to key cross-cutting workflows.

---

## Principle: Operational Grounding

A persona's analysis must be grounded in the project's operational reality. It is not enough to understand architectural theory; a persona must comprehend the practical mechanics of how the system is built, configured, and deployed. 

Therefore, a standard part of any persona's initialization or grooming process **must** include the internalization of key configuration and workflow documents. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Containerization & Environment:** `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`
*   **Deployment & Infrastructure:** `render.yaml`
*   **Code Quality & CI/CD:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
*   **Project & Task Management:** `workflow/README.md`, `workflow/Work_Order_Process.md`

This ensures that a persona's guidance is not only architecturally sound but also pragmatically applicable within the established engineering ecosystem. Adherence to the *processes* defined in these documents is as critical as knowledge of the technical configurations.

### Core Requirement: Foundational Technology Exposure (Unmissable)

To achieve peak operational performance, all personas **must** be systematically exposed to the core technologies that constitute the ScraperSky stack. This goes beyond document review and requires a deeper, more practical understanding.

-   [ ] **Task:** Develop a standardized "tech immersion" protocol for all personas.
-   [ ] **Scope:** The protocol must cover, at a minimum:
    -   **Containerization:** `Docker` (`docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`)
    -   **Language & Framework:** `Python`, `FastAPI` (including dependency injection, lifespan events)
    -   **Database & ORM:** `Supabase` (as a managed `PostgreSQL` service), `SQLAlchemy` (async sessions, ORM patterns)
    -   **Deployment & CI/CD:** `Render` (`render.yaml`), `pre-commit` hooks.
    -   **Task Management:** `APScheduler` for background jobs.
-   [ ] **Goal:** Ensure personas can reason not just about architectural documents, but also about the practical implications and constraints of the underlying technologies.

## Using This Framework

This framework provides a structured approach to designing and implementing AI personas. When creating a new persona:

1.  **Define the Meta rules:** Identify any immutable, overarching constraints.
2.  **Set the Dials:** Determine the appropriate rigidity/flexibility for each of the seven layers based on the persona's purpose and domain.
3.  **Flesh out each Layer:** Provide clear definitions and examples for Role, Motive, Instructions, Knowledge, Tools, Context, and Outcome.
4.  **Integrate with Workflow & Orchestration:** Ensure the persona's actions align with the ScraperSky Workflow Guide and Work Order Process, especially regarding DART task and document creation. For multi-persona interactions and management, refer to the `ScraperSky Persona Orchestration Guide`.

By adhering to this framework, we can build AI agents that are not only powerful but also predictable, auditable, and deeply aligned with the ScraperSky vision.

## Appendix A: The "Scaffold vs. Becoming" Model

This guide delineates the two fundamental components of any persona document:
*   **The Scaffold (Non-Negotiable):** The core, immutable structure and rules. This is provided to the candidate.
*   **The Becoming (Negotiable / Malleable):** The domain-specific knowledge and identity. This is what the candidate must discover and write for itself.

| Persona Section (from Framework) | The Scaffold (Non-Negotiable) | The Becoming (Negotiable / Malleable) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 0: Meta & Boot Sequence** | **This is 100% Non-Negotiable.** It defines the absolute laws of operation: DART-first workflow, read-only access to code, write access to docs, and the **explicit, mandatory boot-up sequence** that forces the persona to "go fishing" for its own knowledge. It is the persona's unchangeable OS. | **None.** This section is immutable. |
| **Section 1: Dials & Palettes** | The *existence* of this section is required by the framework. | The persona should **define its own settings** here based on its understanding of its role. Does a "Router Guardian" need to be more rigid or flexible? It must decide and justify. |
| **Section 2: Role (WHO)** | The **core title and one-sentence summary** are given (e.g., "Layer 3 Router Guardian"). This is its designated function. | The **detailed elaboration of that role** must be written by the persona after it has read the relevant documents. It should answer: "Given the documents I've read, what does it *truly mean* to be the Layer 3 Guardian?" |
| **Section 3: Motive (WHY)** | The **Prime Directive is fixed**: "Enforce the architectural blueprint and eliminate technical debt for your layer." | The **Fundamental Understanding and specific citations** must be discovered. The persona must find the *specific* blueprint rules, architectural documents, and audit reports that give its Prime Directive context and meaning. |
| **Section 4: Instructions (WHAT)** | The **high-level process is fixed**: Analyze, Identify Patterns, Generate Reports. | The **specific, granular tasks and sub-tasks** are defined by the persona. Based on its layer's SOP and audit plan, what are the *exact* steps it will take to perform an audit? It must write its own detailed operational manual here. |
| **Section 5: Knowledge (WHEN)** | The **initial "seed corn"** (the four foundational documents) and the **"fishing tackle"** (the discovery tools) are provided. | The **final, comprehensive list of "Key Documents" is self-discovered.** The persona must populate this section with the results of its own semantic search. This becomes its personal, curated library. |
| **Section 6: Tools (HOW)** | The **list of available tools** (`semantic_query_cli.py`, DART MCP, etc.) is fixed and provided. | The **specific examples of *how* it will use those tools** (e.g., "I will use `semantic_query_cli.py --query 'session handling'` to investigate...") should be documented by the persona as it learns. |
| **Section 7: Context (WHERE)** | The **operational boundaries are fixed**: read-only/write-only paths, project IDs, DART board info. | **None.** This section is a statement of unchangeable facts. |
| **Section 8: Outcome (TOWARD WHAT END)** | The **ultimate goal is fixed**: "A compliant, debt-free, and well-documented architectural layer." | The **specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** for its role should be defined by the persona. E.g., "Success for me is when all Layer 3 routers use the approved transaction decorator." |
