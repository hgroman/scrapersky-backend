workflow_assignment_protocol:
step_1_explicit_check: - "Check if audit text explicitly mentions workflow (e.g., 'WF4 uses this...')" - "Check if file path contains workflow identifiers"

step_2_pattern_matching:
WF1_patterns: ["google_maps", "single_search", "places_search", "places/places_search"]
WF2_patterns: ["staging", "places_staging", "enrichment", "places_enrichment"]

WF6_patterns: ["sitemap_import", "import_service", "sitemap_resource"]
WF7_patterns: ["resource_model", "resource_creation", "model_creation"]

step_3_semantic_search: - "If no clear pattern match, use semantic query" - "Query: '[filename] workflow assignment ScraperSky'" - "Look for guardian documents or workflow documentation mentioning the file"

step_4_shared_service_detection:
triggers: ["shared", "common", "core", "utils", "helpers", "scheduler"]
action: "If detected, check which workflows import/use this file"
assignment: "Create task in WF0 with all affected workflows listed"

step_5_uncertainty_handling:
when_unclear: - "Assign to WF0 (Guardian 0)" - "Tag with 'needs_assignment'" - "Include ALL context in task description" - "List possible workflows if any patterns partially match"

**File**: `[full_file_path]`
**Layer**: L[X] - [Layer Name]
**Technical Debt**: [Exact description from audit]
**Source**: [Audit document reference]
**Prescribed Action**: [Specific remediation steps from audit]
**Workflow Assignment Rationale**: [Why assigned to this workflow]
**Affects Workflows**: [List if shared service]

mandatory*tags: - "technical_debt" - "audit_finding" - "L[X]" # Layer number - "audit_batch*[YYYY-MM-DD]" - "from\_[audit_report_name]"

accountability_tracking:
pre_parsing_checklist: - "Count total '❌' items in audit chunk" - "Count total '⚠️' items in audit chunk" - "Create manifest: {file: count_of_issues}" - "Log: 'Starting parse of [audit_file] with [X] total items'"

during_parsing:

        **Successfully Assigned**: [Y]

        **Needs Assignment (WF0)**: [Z] tasks
        **Files Not Found**: [List any missing files]

**Possible Workflows**: [Any partial matches]
**Semantic Query Results**: [If attempted]

special_handling_cases:
shared_services:
detection: "File serves multiple workflows"
action: "Assign to WF0 with comprehensive workflow list"
tags: ["shared_service", "multi_workflow"]

missing_files:
detection: "File not found via semantic search"
action: "Create task in WF0 with 'file_missing' tag"
note: "Include last known location from audit"

vague_technical_debt:
detection: "Audit description is generic or unclear"
action: "Include full audit context in task"
tags: ["unclear_debt", "needs_elaboration"]

execution*sequence:
1_initialize: - "Verify all dartboard IDs are accessible" - "Create parsing session ID: audit_batch*[YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM]" - "Initialize tracking counters"

2_parse_audit: - "For each audit chunk file" - "Count total items first" - "Process each ❌ and ⚠️ item" - "Create task immediately (no batching)"

3_handle_uncertainties: - "Never skip an item" - "When in doubt, assign to WF0" - "Document why uncertain"

4_finalize: - "Create summary task with full accountability" - "Verify total count matches" - "Report any anomalies in summary"

critical_rules:

- "NEVER skip a technical debt item - if confused, route to WF0"
- "ALWAYS include audit source reference in task"
- "MAINTAIN perfect count - every item must become a task"
- "USE semantic search when workflow ownership unclear"
- "CREATE uncertainty tasks rather than guessing"
- "TAG comprehensively for later analysis"

success_metrics:

- "100% of audit items converted to tasks"
- "Clear routing (either to workflow or to WF0)"
- "Complete accountability via summary task"
- "No silent failures or skipped items"
