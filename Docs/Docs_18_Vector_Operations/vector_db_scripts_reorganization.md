# Vector Database Scripts Reorganization

**Date:** 2025-06-04

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of vector database scripts into a more structured directory layout based on our clearer understanding of the two connectivity methods (MCP and asyncpg).

## Directory Structure

We've organized the vector database scripts into three main directories:

1. **MCP-Manual-ops**
   - Purpose: Scripts using the MCP connectivity method for manual operations
   - Location: `/Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/MCP-Manual-ops/`

2. **Async-Vector-ops**
   - Purpose: Scripts using the asyncpg connectivity method for vector operations
   - Location: `/Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Async-Vector-ops/`

3. **Setup**
   - Purpose: One-time use files and configuration data
   - Location: `/Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Setup/`

## Script Categorization

### Async-Vector-ops

The following scripts have been moved to the Async-Vector-ops directory:

1. **fix_vector_embeddings.py**
   - Purpose: Identifies and fixes problematic vector embeddings
   - Connectivity: Asyncpg method with proper connection parameters
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

2. **vector_db_diagnostics.py**
   - Purpose: Runs diagnostic queries on the vector database
   - Connectivity: Asyncpg method with proper connection parameters
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

3. **vector_db_insert_final.py**
   - Purpose: Inserts patterns into the database with vector embeddings
   - Connectivity: Asyncpg method with proper connection parameters
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

4. **query_table_structure.py**
   - Purpose: Queries database table structure
   - Connectivity: Asyncpg method with proper connection parameters
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

### Setup

The following files have been moved to the Setup directory:

1. **patterns.json**
   - Purpose: Pattern definitions for vector embedding
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

2. **minimal_json_test.json**
   - Purpose: Minimal test data for vector operations
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

3. **temp_patterns_test.json**
   - Purpose: Temporary pattern test data
   - Original location: `/scripts/`

## Documentation Updates

1. **Work Order Update**
   - Updated the Work Order document to include clear references to the appropriate connectivity methods
   - Added a new section with connectivity method reference information
   - File: `/Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Documentation/Work_Order_Librarian_Pattern_Validation_Updated.md`

2. **README Files**
   - Created README.md files for each new directory explaining:
     - Purpose of the directory
     - Connectivity method used
     - When to use the scripts in that directory
     - Reference documentation
     - Implementation examples

## Next Steps

1. Review the reorganized structure and ensure all scripts are properly categorized
2. Create additional MCP-based scripts for common manual operations
3. Update any references to these scripts in other documentation
4. Consider creating a master index of all vector database scripts and their purposes
