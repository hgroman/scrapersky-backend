# Handoff: Embedding Status Migration & Testing Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-09
**Project:** ScraperSky Backend - Document Registry System
**Work Order:** `work_order_5_testing_status_field_migration.md`

## 1. Overall Objective

The primary goal was to test and validate the migration of the ScraperSky document registry system to use a single, standardized `embedding_status` field, ensuring correct document lifecycle management (ingestion, vectorization, modification, archival, cleanup) and adherence to architectural principles (separation of concerns).

## 2. Test Case Summary & Outcomes

### Test Case 1: Ingestion & Initial Vectorization (Completed Successfully)
*   **Actions:** Document marked (`v_`), scanned (`2-registry-document-scanner.py`), and vectorized (`insert_architectural_docs.py`).
*   **Outcome:** `embedding_status` correctly transitioned: `(non-existent)` -> `'queue'` -> `'active'`. `insert_architectural_docs.py` was updated to use `last_seen_at` (replacing `last_checked`) and set status to `'active'` (from `'completed'`).

### Test Case 2: Document Modification & Re-vectorization (Completed Successfully)
*   **Actions:** Test document modified, `needs_update` flag set (`3-registry-update-flag-manager.py`), and re-vectorized.
*   **Outcome:** `needs_update` flag correctly triggered re-processing. `embedding_status` remained `'active'` post re-vectorization, as expected.

### Test Case 3: Document Archival (Completed Successfully)
*   **Actions:** Test document renamed (simulating deletion), scanner run (no archival action, correct), archival manager run (`4-registry-archive-manager.py`).
*   **Outcome:** `embedding_status` correctly transitioned to `'archived'`. 
    *   **Key Fix:** `4-registry-archive-manager.py` was modified to correctly resolve relative `file_path` entries (stored in DB relative to project root) by constructing absolute paths before checking file existence. This resolved an issue where existing files were incorrectly reported as missing.

### Test Case 4: Cleanup of Archived Documents (Partially Completed)
*   **Actions:** `5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py` (note correct filename) run with `cleanup --auto-approve` action.
*   **Outcome:** 
    *   Successfully removed document embeddings from the **vector database** for records with `embedding_status = 'archived'`. 
    *   **Critical Finding:** This script, with the `cleanup` action, **does NOT remove the corresponding records from the `document_registry` table.** Records remain in `document_registry` with `status = 'archived'`. This deviates from the work order's implication of full cleanup from both systems by this script.

### Test Case 5: Semantic Search Verification (Pending)
*   This test case has not yet been executed.

## 3. Key Script Information & Discoveries (for Persona Update & Future Work)

*   **`0-registry_librarian_persona.md` Updates:**
    *   Added "Guiding Principles for Development & Collaboration" section, including "Architectural Integrity Mandate" and "Principle of Semantic Integrity & Meaning Consolidation."
*   **`4-registry-archive-manager.py`:**
    *   **Path Logic:** Assumes `file_path` in `document_registry` is relative to the project root. The script now correctly calculates absolute paths using `project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent.parent` before checking existence.
    *   **CLI:** `python 4-registry-archive-manager.py --scan` for interactive archival.
*   **`5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py`:**
    *   **Correct Filename:** `5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py` (not `5-registry-cleanup-manager.py`).
    *   **CLI Usage:** Requires an `action` argument (`list_candidates` or `cleanup`). Effective command for cleanup: `python 5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py cleanup --auto-approve`.
    *   **Current Scope:** The `cleanup` action **only removes entries from the vector database**. It does NOT delete records from the `document_registry` table.

## 4. Open Points & Next Steps for Investigation

1.  **`document_registry` Cleanup:** The process for deleting records with `embedding_status = 'archived'` from the `document_registry` table needs to be defined and implemented/clarified. Options:
    *   Enhance `5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py` with a new action or flag.
    *   Create a new dedicated script for `document_registry` purging.
    *   Define as a manual SQL step (less ideal).
    *   Investigate if `5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py --help` reveals other relevant (undocumented in persona) options.
2.  **`APPROVED_DIRECTORIES` Warnings:** The `2-registry-document-scanner.py` emits warnings about some `APPROVED_DIRECTORIES` paths not being found or not being directories. This needs investigation to ensure reliable scanning across all intended locations (see MEMORY[5795d65f]).
3.  **Complete Test Case 5:** Proceed with semantic search verification.
4.  **Update `0-registry_librarian_persona.md`:** Incorporate the correct filename, CLI arguments, and functional scope for `5-vector-db-cleanup-manager.py`. Add details about the path resolution logic in `4-registry-archive-manager.py` if deemed necessary for the persona's understanding.

## 5. Future Considerations (Strategic)

As per MEMORY[70bad876], a long-term vision exists to migrate document storage to a cloud-based solution (e.g., Notion, Dart via MCP) and ideally leverage automated vectorization services. This would enhance robustness and streamline the pipeline.

This document summarizes the current state and provides a foundation for the next phase of work on the ScraperSky document registry system.
