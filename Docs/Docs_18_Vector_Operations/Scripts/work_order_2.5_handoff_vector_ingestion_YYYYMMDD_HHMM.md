# Handoff Document: Vector DB Ingestion Pipeline Enhancement

**Date:** 2025-06-08
**Project:** ScraperSky Backend - Vector Database Integration
**Handoff From:** Cascade AI (Session ending)
**Handoff To:** Next Cascade AI Agent

## 1. Overall Objective

The primary goal is to modify the `insert_architectural_docs.py` script to dynamically ingest documents into the vector database. This involves:
*   Querying the `document_registry` table for documents flagged for vectorization.
*   Replacing the previous hardcoded document list approach.
*   Ensuring the script correctly updates document status in the `document_registry` after processing.
*   Ultimately, implementing robust tracking fields like `needs_update` and `last_embedded_at` in the `document_registry`.

## 2. Current Sub-Objective

We are currently in the process of testing the end-to-end ingestion pipeline with a new document, `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md`, *before* proceeding with schema modifications outlined in "Work Order Part Two."

## 3. Work Completed & Current State

### 3.1. Script Modifications (`insert_architectural_docs.py`)
*   The script was initially modified to query `document_registry` based on `should_be_vectorized = TRUE` and `embedding_status != 'completed'`.
*   References to non-existent columns (`is_vectorized`, `needs_update` (initial version), `last_embedded_at`) were removed to align with the then-current schema and allow testing. This was a temporary measure.

### 3.2. Work Order for Schema Enhancement
*   A detailed work order, `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/work_order_registry_schema_and_script_mods_part2.md`, was created.
*   **Purpose:** To properly add `needs_update BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL` and `last_embedded_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` columns to the `public.document_registry` table and update `insert_architectural_docs.py` to use them.
*   **This work order is currently PAUSED** pending the successful completion of the current test cycle.

### 3.3. Test Pipeline for `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md`
The following steps were executed to test the ingestion of `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md`:
1.  **Directory Approval:**
    *   Command: `python 1-registry-directory-manager.py --approve /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES`
    *   Outcome: **Successful**. The directory was added to `approved_directories.json`.
2.  **Document Scanning & Registry Update:**
    *   Command: `python 2-registry-document-scanner.py --scan`
    *   Outcome: **Successful**. The script found `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md` and added it to the `document_registry`, marking it for vectorization.
3.  **Vectorization & Ingestion Attempt:**
    *   Command: `python insert_architectural_docs.py`
    *   Outcome: The script ran and processed candidates. Log output indicated that `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md` was likely processed successfully, as it did not appear in the list of `FileNotFoundError` encountered for other documents (which had path issues in the registry).

## 4. Pending Action (At Time of Handoff)

*   **Verification of `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md`'s status in the database.**
*   To perform this verification, two `mcp4_execute_sql` tool calls were issued (as per `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/MCP-Manual-ops/README.md` and `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Documentation/v_db_connectivity_mcp_4_manual_ops.md`):
    1.  **Query 1 (document_registry):**
        ```sql
        SELECT id, title, file_path, should_be_vectorized, embedding_status, error_message FROM public.document_registry WHERE title = 'v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md';
        ```
    2.  **Query 2 (project_docs):**
        ```sql
        SELECT doc_id, doc_title, doc_source_path, last_updated_at, embedding IS NOT NULL AS has_embedding FROM public.project_docs WHERE title = 'v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md';
        ```
*   **CRITICAL: The results of these `mcp4_execute_sql` calls were NOT YET RECEIVED at the time this handoff document was created.**

## 5. Next Steps for Next AI Agent

1.  **Obtain and Analyze MCP Query Results:**
    *   The immediate next step is to get the results of the two `mcp4_execute_sql` queries listed above. If the results did not come through before this session ended, **these queries will need to be re-issued.**
    *   **Expected outcome for `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md`:**
        *   In `document_registry`: `should_be_vectorized = FALSE`, `embedding_status = 'completed'`.
        *   In `project_docs`: An entry exists with `has_embedding = TRUE` and a recent `last_updated_at`.
2.  **If `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md` is Confirmed Successful:**
    *   Proceed with the USER's request to "have another AI chat query the vector database and ensure that it can see that document." This involves:
        1.  **Client-Side Embedding Generation:** Generate an embedding for a relevant search query (e.g., related to 'DART MCP GUIDE') using the OpenAI API.
        2.  **Direct Similarity Search:** Use the generated embedding in an `mcp4_execute_sql` call to query the `project_docs` table directly for similar vectors. For example:
            ```sql
            -- Assume '[CLIENT_GENERATED_EMBEDDING]' is replaced with the actual vector string
            SELECT title, content, 1 - (embedding <=> '[CLIENT_GENERATED_EMBEDDING]'::vector) AS similarity 
            FROM public.project_docs 
            ORDER BY similarity DESC 
            LIMIT 5;
            ```
            Refer to `v_db_connectivity_mcp_4_manual_ops.md` for the detailed client-side embedding and query pattern.
    *   After successful semantic verification, **resume "Work Order Part Two"**:
        *   **Modify `document_registry` schema:** Add `needs_update` and `last_embedded_at` columns using `mcp4_execute_sql` to execute `ALTER TABLE` commands.
            *   `ALTER TABLE public.document_registry ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS needs_update BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL;`
            *   `ALTER TABLE public.document_registry ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_embedded_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL;`
        *   **Update `insert_architectural_docs.py`:** Modify the script's logic to correctly utilize these new columns for querying candidates and updating status (as detailed in the work order).
3.  **If `v_34-DART_MCP_GUIDE.md` Processing Failed (based on query results):**
    *   Diagnose the failure reason using the query results (e.g., check `error_message` in `document_registry`).
    *   Address the issue and re-run the necessary parts of the test pipeline.
4.  **Address Path Issues:**
    *   The logs for `2-registry-document-scanner.py` and `insert_architectural_docs.py` showed warnings and errors related to relative vs. absolute paths for some documents/directories.
    *   Review and update `approved_directories.json` to use absolute paths.
    *   Investigate and correct `file_path` entries in `document_registry` that are causing `FileNotFoundError` in `insert_architectural_docs.py`. Ensure they are absolute paths if the script requires it.
