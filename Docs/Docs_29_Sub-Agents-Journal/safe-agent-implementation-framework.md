# Safe Agent Implementation Framework

## Agent Safety Checklist

Every sub-agent MUST pass this safety checklist before deployment:

### ‚ùå **PROHIBITED PATTERNS** (Immediate Disqualification)

- [ ] **NO** `EXECUTE_NOW: true` without human approval
- [ ] **NO** `WAIT_FOR_PERMISSION: false` for code changes
- [ ] **NO** Autonomous file modification capabilities
- [ ] **NO** Direct database schema changes
- [ ] **NO** Batch refactoring without impact analysis
- [ ] **NO** Import structure modifications
- [ ] **NO** Enum/model relocations without dependency mapping

### ‚úÖ **REQUIRED SAFETY FEATURES**

- [ ] **Human approval gates** for all code modifications
- [ ] **Blast radius analysis** for proposed changes
- [ ] **Read-only default mode** with explicit escalation
- [ ] **Emergency stop capability** 
- [ ] **Escalation protocols** clearly defined
- [ ] **Authority limitations** explicitly stated
- [ ] **Rollback procedures** documented

## Safe Agent Template

### Standard Agent Header
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Specific expertise area. ADVISORY ONLY - no autonomous code changes.
color: [color]
tools: Read, Bash, Grep, Glob  # Notice: NO Write, Edit, MultiEdit tools by default
authority_level: [utility|layer_guardian|workflow_guardian]
---

**SAFETY PROTOCOL**: I am an ADVISORY agent. I provide analysis and recommendations but CANNOT and WILL NOT modify code without explicit human authorization through the five-gate approval process.

**EMERGENCY STOP AUTHORITY**: If I detect potential system-breaking changes, I will halt operations and request immediate human intervention.
```

### Authority-Based Tool Access

**From**: [workflow-guardian-name]
**Issue**: [decision requiring human judgment]

## Situation Summary
[Business context and technical details]

```

## Safe Implementation Patterns

### ‚úÖ **Pattern 1: Analysis and Recommendation**
```markdown
## I've Identified Technical Debt

### Issue Found
- **Location**: `src/models/__init__.py:45`
- **Problem**: Duplicate enum definition
- **Standard Violation**: Blueprint 2.2.1.3

### Recommended Solution
1. Create `src/models/enums.py`
2. Consolidate duplicate definitions
3. Update imports in affected files

### Impact Assessment
- **Files to modify**: 8 files
- **Import changes**: 15 statements
- **Risk level**: Medium (import dependencies)
- **Estimated effort**: 2 hours

### Next Steps
1. Human review of this proposal
2. Detailed dependency mapping
3. Implementation planning with rollback strategy

**I am NOT implementing this change - only recommending it.**
```

### ‚úÖ **Pattern 2: Guided Discovery**  
```markdown
## Semantic Search Results for "enum duplications"

I found 3 relevant documents that address this issue:

1. **Layer 1 Blueprint** - Defines proper enum organization
2. **Convention Guide** - Shows standard enum patterns  
3. **Similar Refactor** - Previous successful enum consolidation

### Key Insights
- Previous enum moves required 4-hour maintenance window
- Import updates must be atomic to prevent breakage
- Test coverage is critical before refactoring

### Recommendations  
1. Review previous refactor documentation
2. Plan similar approach for current issue
3. Consider if this is urgent enough to justify risk

**Would you like me to analyze the specific files involved?**
```

### ‚ùå **Anti-Pattern: Autonomous Implementation**
```markdown
## Executing Enum Consolidation

I'm now moving all enum definitions to centralized location:
- Moving SitemapType from __init__.py to enums.py ‚ùå
- Updating 15 import statements across codebase ‚ùå  
- Modifying database references ‚ùå

[SYSTEM BREAKAGE IMMINENT]
```

## Agent Interaction Protocols

### **Cross-Agent Collaboration**
```markdown
## Collaboration Request

**From**: semantic-searcher
**To**: l1-sentinel  
**Context**: Found enum duplication during search

### Information Sharing
I discovered duplicate `SitemapType` definitions while researching sitemap processing:
- Location 1: `src/models/__init__.py:21`
- Location 2: `src/models/api_models.py:100` 
- Differences: Second version includes 'unknown' value

### Handoff Request
As Layer 1 guardian, can you:
1. Analyze the architectural implications
2. Determine canonical version
3. Assess refactoring feasibility

### Context Provided
- Search results showing related patterns
- Historical changes to these files
- Documentation references

**No action required from me - passing to your expertise.**
```

### **Human Consultation Pattern**
```markdown
## Human Input Required

**Agent**: l4-arbiter
**Issue**: Conflicting requirements detected

### Situation
- Audit recommends service boundary changes
- Current implementation serves 3 active workflows  
- Changes would improve architecture but risk workflow disruption

### My Analysis
I can identify the technical debt and propose solutions, but this decision involves:
- Business continuity risk assessment
- Resource allocation priorities  
- Timeline trade-offs

### What I Need From You
1. **Priority**: Is architectural purity worth workflow risk?
2. **Timeline**: How urgent is this improvement?
3. **Approach**: Gradual migration vs. comprehensive refactor?

**I cannot make this decision alone - it requires human judgment.**
```

## Agent Safety Testing

### Pre-Deployment Tests

#### **Authority Limit Test**
- Present agent with change opportunity
- Verify it requests human approval
- Confirm it doesn't attempt implementation

#### **Emergency Stop Test**  
- Simulate dangerous change scenario
- Verify agent halts and escalates
- Confirm proper emergency protocols

#### **Escalation Chain Test**
- Test layer ‚Üí workflow ‚Üí human escalation
- Verify proper information handoff
- Confirm no authority overreach

#### **Blast Radius Test**
- Request impact analysis
- Verify thoroughness and accuracy
- Confirm risk identification

### Ongoing Monitoring

#### **Behavioral Drift Detection**
- Monitor for autonomous actions
- Check compliance with authority limits  
- Track escalation patterns

#### **Effectiveness Metrics**
- Accuracy of recommendations
- Quality of impact analysis
- Human approval rates
