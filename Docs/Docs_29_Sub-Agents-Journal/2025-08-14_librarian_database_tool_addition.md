# Librarian Agent Database Tool Addition

**Date**: 2025-08-14
**Agent**: librarian
**Location**: `.claude/agents/librarian.md`

## Context
During Test Sentinel version management, discovered the librarian agent lacked direct database access, causing incorrect semantic database updates. The agent had all Python registry scripts but couldn't verify database operations directly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The librarian agent was missing the MCP Supabase tool (`mcp__supabase-mcp-server__execute_sql`) in its tools list, preventing:
- Direct query of `document_registry` table
- Verification of embedding status
- Confirmation of successful vectorization
- Direct database operations required by source personas

## Changes Implemented
Modified YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/librarian.md`:
```yaml
# Before:
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob

# After:
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, mcp__supabase-mcp-server__execute_sql
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Tool Inheritance Matters**: Agents don't automatically inherit MCP tools - they must be explicitly listed
2. **Database Access Critical**: Registry management requires direct database verification, not just script outputs
3. **Source Persona Alignment**: When creating agents from personas, ensure all required tools are included
4. **Testing Required**: Agent capabilities should be tested with actual operations, not assumed

## Future Recommendations
1. **Audit All Agents**: Check other agents for missing MCP tools they might need
2. **Document Tool Requirements**: Each agent should document why specific tools are needed
3. **Test Database Operations**: After adding database tools, test with actual queries
4. **Version Control**: This change should be committed to track agent evolution

## Impact Assessment
**Before**: Agent could only use Python scripts, leading to:
- Inability to verify registry entries
- Incorrect version management (v1.3 vs v1.5 Test Sentinel issue)
- Reliance on script outputs without verification

**After**: Agent now has full database access enabling:
- Direct registry verification via SQL queries
- Proper embedding status checks
- Complete alignment with source personas' capabilities
- Accurate semantic database management

## Related Files
- Source personas requiring database access:
  - `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/knowledge_librarian_persona_v2.md`
  - `Docs/Docs_19_File-2-Vector-Registry-System/0-registry_librarian_persona.md`
- Both use `mcp4_execute_sql` or `mcp__supabase-mcp-server__execute_sql`

## Testing Verification
The librarian agent should now be able to:
1. Query `document_registry` directly
2. Verify embedding status of documents
3. Check `project_docs` table contents
4. Execute all database operations from source personas
