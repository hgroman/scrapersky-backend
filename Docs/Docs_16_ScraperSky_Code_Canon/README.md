# ARCHIVED: ScraperSky Vector Database Documentation

> **IMPORTANT: This directory is now ARCHIVED**
>
> All content in this directory has been migrated to the new standardized location at:
> `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/`

## Purpose of This Archive

This directory previously contained the primary vector database documentation and scripts for the ScraperSky project. As part of the documentation reorganization effort (completed on 2025-06-03), all files have been:

1. Migrated to the new directory structure
2. Renamed according to the standardized naming convention:
   - Only documentation files intended for vectorization have the `v_` prefix
   - Scripts and supporting files do not use the `v_` prefix
3. Updated with consistent references and paths
