## Preamble: Relation to Core Architectural Principles

Layer 6 standards support Core Architectural Principles from `1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md`, particularly:

- **UI Component Integration:** By defining how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS should be structured and interact.
- **Layered Architectural Awareness:** By ensuring UI components have clear responsibilities and interact with the backend (Layer 3 APIs) in a standardized way.

This Blueprint translates those principles into auditable criteria for frontend components.

## 1. Core Principle(s) for Layer 6: User Interface Presentation & Interaction

Layer 6 is designated as "UI Components". Its core principles are:

- **Presentation:** To render data and provide visual structure for the user interface, primarily using HTML and CSS.
- **Interaction:** To handle user interactions and dynamic UI updates, primarily using JavaScript.
- **Modularity:** To organize UI code (HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript) into reusable and maintainable components or modules.
- **Standardization:** To enforce consistent structure, naming, and patterns for UI elements, especially for recurring patterns like tab-based interfaces.
- **Separation of Concerns:** To keep presentation logic (HTML/CSS) largely separate from client-side interaction logic (JavaScript), and both separate from backend business logic.

---

## 2. Standard Pattern(s): UI Component Structure & Behavior

Layer 6 encompasses HTML templates, CSS styling, and client-side JavaScript.

### 2.1. HTML Structure & Templating

- **Pattern:** Server-side templating (e.g., Jinja2 if used with FastAPI) for dynamic HTML generation; static HTML for simpler pages.
- **Definition & Scope:** Defines the semantic structure of web pages and UI elements.
- **Location:** Typically `src/templates/` for server-side templates, `src/static/html/` or similar for static pages.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Structuring content semantically using appropriate HTML5 tags.
  - Integrating with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
  - For dynamic templates: rendering data passed from the backend.
- **Key Compliance Criteria:**
  1.  **Semantic HTML:** Use HTML tags according to their meaning (e.g., `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<button>`).
  2.  **Accessibility (Basic):** Ensure basic accessibility features like `alt` text for images, proper label-input associations, and keyboard navigability for interactive elements.
  3.  **Naming Conventions:** HTML `id` and `class` attributes should follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `kebab-case`, BEM-like if adopted).
      - _Source:_ `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` (if specified for HTML/CSS).
  4.  **Template Organization:** Templates should be organized logically, potentially with base templates and includable partials/components.
  5.  **No Inline Styles/Script:** Avoid inline `style` attributes and inline `<script>` tags with substantial logic. Prefer external CSS and JS files.

### 2.2. CSS Styling

- **Pattern:** External CSS files, potentially using a preprocessor (like SASS/SCSS) if adopted, or plain CSS.
- **Definition & Scope:** Defines the visual presentation of HTML elements.
- **Location:** Typically `src/static/css/` or `src/static/styles/`.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Styling UI elements according to design specifications.
  - Ensuring responsive design if required.
  - Maintaining a consistent visual language.
- **Key Compliance Criteria:**
  1.  **External Stylesheets:** All significant CSS must be in external `.css` files.
  2.  **Naming Conventions:** CSS class names should follow a consistent, documented convention (e.g., BEM, `kebab-case`).
      - _Source:_ `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` (if specified).
  3.  **Modularity:** CSS should be organized into logical modules/components where possible.
  4.  **Specificity Management:** Avoid overly specific selectors or excessive use of `!important`.
  5.  **Readability:** CSS should be well-formatted and readable.

### 2.3. Client-Side JavaScript

- **Pattern:** Modular JavaScript, potentially using ES6 modules. Event-driven programming for interactivity.
- **Definition & Scope:** Handles dynamic UI updates, user interactions, and communication with backend APIs (AJAX/Fetch).
- **Location:** Typically `src/static/js/` or `src/static/scripts/`.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - DOM manipulation for dynamic content updates.
  - Event handling (clicks, form submissions, etc.).
  - Making asynchronous requests to Layer 3 API endpoints.
  - Client-side validation (as a preliminary check, not replacing backend validation).
  - Managing client-side state if applicable (for more complex UIs).
  - Implementing standard UI patterns like tabbed interfaces.
    - _Source:_ `1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md` (Modular JavaScript, Tab-based interface pattern).
- **Key Compliance Criteria:**
  1.  **External Scripts:** All significant JavaScript must be in external `.js` files.
  2.  **Modularity:** JavaScript code should be organized into modules/functions with clear responsibilities.
      - _Source:_ `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` (if specified, e.g., for tab UI JS modules).
  3.  **No Global Namespace Pollution:** Minimize use of global variables; use modules or IIFEs.
  4.  **DOM Interaction:** Use efficient and safe DOM manipulation techniques.
  5.  **API Communication:** API calls should be centralized or use a consistent helper function. Error handling for API requests must be implemented.
  6.  **Event Handling:** Use modern event listener attachment (`addEventListener`).
  7.  **Readability & Linting:** Code should be well-formatted, readable, and ideally adhere to a linter configuration (e.g., ESLint).
  8.  **Security (Basic):** Avoid common client-side vulnerabilities like XSS by properly handling data displayed on the page (though server-side sanitization is primary).

### 2.4. Static Asset Management

- **Pattern:** Organized directory structure for static assets.
- **Definition & Scope:** Management of CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, and other static files served to the client.
- **Location:** Typically rooted in `src/static/` with subdirectories like `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `fonts/`.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Storing and serving static assets efficiently.
  - Ensuring assets are correctly linked from HTML files.
- **Key Compliance Criteria:**
  1.  **Organized Structure:** Static assets must be organized into logical subdirectories within `src/static/` (or equivalent).
  2.  **Correct Linking:** Paths to static assets in HTML and CSS must be correct.
  3.  **Optimization (Optional but Recommended):** Minification of CSS/JS for production, image optimization.

## 3. Documented Exception Pattern(s)

- **Third-Party Libraries/Frameworks:** If a specific UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Vue, React) is adopted for certain parts of the application, its own conventions might override some general HTML/CSS/JS rules. This adoption must be documented as an explicit architectural decision and include guidelines on its usage.
- **Minimal Inline JS for Initialization:** Very small, configuration-specific JavaScript (e.g., initializing a JS library with a dynamic value from a template) might be permissible inline if it's truly minimal and non-reusable, but this is strongly discouraged for any actual logic.

## 4. Audit & Assessment Guidance

**Core Philosophy:** Auditing Layer 6 ensures that the user interface is built with semantic HTML, styled consistently with modular CSS, and powered by well-organized, maintainable JavaScript. It also verifies that UI components interact correctly with the backend APIs and adhere to established conventions for structure and asset management. Deviations can lead to poor user experience, inconsistent design, difficult maintenance, and security vulnerabilities.

When auditing Layer 6 components (`src/templates/`, `src/static/` directories and their contents):

1.  **Identify Component Type:** Determine if it's an HTML template, CSS file, JavaScript module, or static asset.

2.  **Assess Against Specific Criteria:**

    - Systematically check the component against the relevant criteria in Section 2 (2.1 for HTML, 2.2 for CSS, 2.3 for JS, 2.4 for Assets).
    - **For HTML:** Check for semantic correctness, accessibility basics, and avoidance of inline styles/scripts.
    - **For CSS:** Check for external stylesheets, naming conventions, and modularity.
    - **For JavaScript:** Check for modularity, safe DOM manipulation, proper API interaction, and event handling.
    - **For Static Assets:** Check for organized directory structure.
    - If a documented exception (like a UI framework) is in use, assess against its specific guidelines as well.

3.  **Document Technical Debt:** Clearly document deviations. This includes:

    - Non-semantic HTML, missing `alt` tags.
    - Inline styles or significant inline scripts.
    - CSS not following naming conventions or being overly specific.
    - Monolithic, non-modular JavaScript files, global namespace pollution.
    - Inefficient or unsafe DOM manipulation.
    - Missing error handling for API calls in JS.
    - Disorganized static asset folders.
    - Violations of established tab-interface patterns or other UI component standards.

4.  **Prescribe Refactoring Actions:** Suggest actions to align with the Blueprint.
    - **Prioritize:** Accessibility issues, security vulnerabilities (like XSS vectors if obvious in JS), major structural problems.
    - Examples:
      - "Refactor HTML template `X` to use semantic tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<article>`)."
      - "Move inline styles from `Y.html` to an external CSS file."
      - "Break down `scripts.js` into smaller, more focused modules."
      - "Implement consistent CSS class naming (e.g., BEM) in `styles.css`."
      - "Add error handling to fetch calls in `api_client.js`."
      - "Organize images in `src/static/` into an `img/` subdirectory."
