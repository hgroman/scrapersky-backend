# Layer 7: Testing - Audit Report

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Auditor:** Roo (David Shepherd Persona)

## 1. Audit Scope and Methodology

This report details the findings of an audit of the ScraperSky backend's Layer 7 (Testing) components, conducted according to the `Layer-7-Testing_AI_Audit_SOP.md` and evaluated against the standards defined in the `Layer-7-Testing_Blueprint.md`.

The audit examined:
- Test file organization and naming
- Individual test structure, naming, and assertions
- Use of test types (unit, integration) and isolation
- Fixture usage and scope
- Mocking and patching practices
- Test data management and isolation
- CI testing integration (based on available configuration files)

## 2. Audit Findings: Component-by-Component Assessment

### 2.1 Test Framework & Organization

| Aspect             | Assessment                                                                 | Standard Comparison & Gap Analysis (Deviations from Blueprint) | Prescribed Refactoring Actions | Status |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------|
| Framework Usage    | Pytest appears to be the primary framework based on file names and structure. | Compliant with Blueprint 2.1.1.                                | None                           | To Do  |
| Test File Naming   | Files generally follow `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.                         | Compliant with Blueprint 2.1.2.                                | None                           | To Do  |
| Directory Structure| Some mirroring of `src/` structure (`scheduler/`, `services/`), but some files at root. | Minor deviation from Blueprint 2.1.3 (mirroring `src/`).       | Organize root-level test files into appropriate subdirectories. | To Do  |

### 2.2 Individual Test Files & Functions

*(Findings for specific test files will be added here as they are audited)*

### 2.3 Fixtures (`conftest.py` and local fixtures)

| Aspect         | Assessment                                                                 | Standard Comparison & Gap Analysis (Deviations from Blueprint) | Prescribed Refactoring Actions                                                                 | Status |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Fixture Usage  | Basic fixtures for common data (`business_type`, `job_id`, `batch_id`, `domain`) are present in `conftest.py`. | Partially compliant with Blueprint 2.3.1 (DRY principle). More comprehensive fixtures may be needed. | Create additional shared fixtures in `conftest.py` for common test setup (e.g., database session, API client). | To Do  |
| Scope Management| `session` and `function` scopes are used.                                  | Compliant with Blueprint 2.3.2.                                | None                                                                                           | To Do  |
| `conftest.py`  | Shared fixtures are located in `conftest.py`.                              | Compliant with Blueprint 2.3.3.                                | None                                                                                           | To Do  |
| Naming         | Fixture names are clear.                                                   | Compliant with Blueprint 2.3.4.                                | None                                                                                           | To Do  |

### 2.4 Mocking & Patching Practices

*(Findings for mocking practices will be added here as test files are audited)*

*(Findings for test data management will be added here as test files are audited)*

### 2.6 CI Testing Integration
