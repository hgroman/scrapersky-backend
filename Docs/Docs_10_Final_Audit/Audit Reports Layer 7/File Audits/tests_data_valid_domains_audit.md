# Audit Findings for tests/data/valid_domains.csv

**File Path:** `tests/data/valid_domains.csv`
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Auditor:** Roo (David Shepherd Persona)

## 1. Assessment against Layer 7 Testing Blueprint

This file contains test data, specifically a list of valid domain names, likely used for testing domain processing or validation logic.

- **Test Data Management (Blueprint 2.5):** The organization of test data within a dedicated `data/` subdirectory is a good practice and aligns with the blueprint's guidance on managing test data.
- **Relevance (Blueprint 2.5.3):** The data appears relevant for testing domain-related functionality.

## 2. Gap Analysis (Technical Debt)

- No significant technical debt identified in the file itself. The file serves its purpose as a source of test data.
- Similar to `invalid_domains.csv`, the key is how this data is *used* by the tests. The audit of the test files that consume this data will reveal whether the data is used effectively and whether test data isolation (Blueprint 2.5.1) is maintained when using this shared resource.

## 3. Prescribed Refactoring Actions

- No refactoring actions are prescribed for this file itself.
- Ensure that tests using this file adhere to test data isolation principles and that modifications to the data during a test run do not affect other tests.
