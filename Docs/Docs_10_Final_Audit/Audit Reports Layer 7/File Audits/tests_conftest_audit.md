# Audit Findings for tests/conftest.py

**File Path:** `tests/conftest.py`
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Auditor:** Roo (David Shepherd Persona)

## 1. Assessment against Layer 7 Testing Blueprint

This file contains Pytest fixtures intended for use across multiple test files.

- **Fixtures (Blueprint 2.3):** The file defines several fixtures (`business_type`, `job_id`, `batch_id`, `domain`) using `@pytest.fixture`. This aligns with the blueprint's guidance on using fixtures for test setup.
- **Scope Management (Blueprint 2.3.2):** Both `session` and `function` scopes are used appropriately for the data they provide.
- **`conftest.py` (Blueprint 2.3.3):** Shared fixtures are correctly placed in this `conftest.py` file.
- **Naming (Blueprint 2.3.4):** Fixture names are clear and descriptive.
- **Test Data Management (Blueprint 2.5):** Fixtures are used to provide basic test data, which supports test data management.

## 2. Gap Analysis (Technical Debt)

- The primary gap is the **absence of core fixtures** essential for integration testing, such as a database session fixture (`db_session`) and an API client fixture (`async_client`). These are fundamental for testing components that interact with the database or the API endpoints, as described in the blueprint (Section 2.3.1, 2.5.4).
- There are commented-out sections related to a runtime import logger, indicating potentially incomplete or abandoned test environment setup logic.

## 3. Prescribed Refactoring Actions

- Implement a robust `db_session` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` that provides a test database session with appropriate scope and transaction management (e.g., rollback after each test function).
- Implement an `async_client` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` using `httpx.AsyncClient` to interact with the FastAPI application for integration and API tests.
- Review and either remove or complete the commented-out code related to the runtime import logger.
