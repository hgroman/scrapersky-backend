# Audit Findings for Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/10-LAYER7_TEST_USER_INFORMATION.md

**File Path:** `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/10-LAYER7_TEST_USER_INFORMATION.md`
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Auditor:** Roo (David Shepherd Persona)

## 1. Assessment against Layer 7 Testing Blueprint

This document is an AI Guide related to Layer 7 testing, specifically concerning test user information.

- **Relevance to Layer 7 (Blueprint 1):** The document is directly relevant to the Testing layer by discussing test user setup.
- **Documentation Currency (Blueprint Preamble, 1.0-ARCH-TRUTH):** The document is explicitly marked as deprecated and containing outdated information regarding RBAC and tenant isolation. This aligns with the known issue of outdated Layer 7 documentation.

## 2. Gap Analysis (Technical Debt)

- The primary technical debt is the outdated nature of the document itself. It provides guidance based on removed systems (RBAC, tenant isolation), making it potentially misleading for current testing efforts.

## 3. Prescribed Refactoring Actions

- Update the document to reflect the current authentication and data models, removing references to RBAC and tenant isolation.
- Provide guidance on how to handle user context or authentication in tests based on the current architectural patterns.
- Ensure the document aligns with the current Layer 7 Testing Blueprint and other up-to-date architectural documentation.
- Consider archiving or clearly marking the document as historical if a complete rewrite is not immediately feasible.
