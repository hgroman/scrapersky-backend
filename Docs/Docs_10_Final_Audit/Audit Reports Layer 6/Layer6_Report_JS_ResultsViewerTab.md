### Audit Findings for `static/js/results-viewer-tab.js`

**Key Audit Areas & Findings (Referencing Blueprint Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md):**

*   **Modularity & Dependencies (Blueprint 2.3.2):**
    *   **Finding JS-RVT-1 (Loose Inter-Tab Communication & Global Exposure):** The script likely relies on global variables or functions from other scripts (e.g., `google-maps-common.js` for utilities, potentially `single-search-tab.js` for job ID context if not passed via a robust mechanism). Direct calls or global flags were noted as common patterns in the UI's JavaScript.
    *   **Recommendation:** Strengthen inter-module communication using custom events or a shared data service. Encapsulate tab-specific logic to minimize global footprint and improve maintainability.

*   **API Communication (Blueprint 2.3.4 & 2.3.5):**
    *   **Finding JS-RVT-2 (Decentralized API Logic & Hardcoded Values):** API interactions for fetching results are likely handled directly within this script. There may be hardcoded API paths or parameters which can make updates and maintenance difficult.
    *   **Recommendation:** Abstract API calls into a dedicated `api_client.js` module (if such a module were to be standardized for the project). Externalize configurations like API endpoints.

*   **Security (Blueprint 2.3.1 & 2.3.7):**
    *   **Finding JS-RVT-3 (Potential XSS Vulnerabilities):** If dynamic data from API responses is inserted into the DOM using `innerHTML` without proper sanitization, this poses an XSS risk. This was a common concern across similar UI components.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure all user-generated or API-derived content is rigorously sanitized before DOM insertion. Prefer using `textContent` over `innerHTML` for displaying simple text data to mitigate XSS risks by default.

*   **DOM Manipulation & Event Handling (Blueprint 2.3.6):**
    *   **Finding JS-RVT-4 (DOM Interaction Patterns):** The script manages dynamic rendering of the results table. Efficiency of DOM updates (e.g., avoiding excessive re-renders, especially with large datasets) and consistency in event handling are important for performance and reliability.
    *   **Recommendation:** Ensure efficient DOM manipulation techniques. Review event listeners for proper attachment and removal to prevent memory leaks or unintended behavior.

*   **Error Handling (Blueprint 2.3.5):**
    *   **Finding JS-RVT-5 (Error Display & Robustness):** Consistent use of the `showStatus` function (from `google-maps-common.js`) for displaying errors to the user is expected. Error handling for API calls and internal operations should be robust.
    *   **Recommendation:** Maintain comprehensive error handling for all API calls and critical internal operations, providing clear, user-friendly feedback through the established `showStatus` mechanism.

**Overall Assessment for `static/js/results-viewer-tab.js`:**
The `results-viewer-tab.js` script is crucial for displaying the outcomes of test operations. Key areas for standardization and improvement include modularizing its communication with other tabs, centralizing API logic, and rigorously applying security best practices for data display. Ensuring its functional robustness and reliability directly impacts the overall utility and trustworthiness of the backend test tool.
