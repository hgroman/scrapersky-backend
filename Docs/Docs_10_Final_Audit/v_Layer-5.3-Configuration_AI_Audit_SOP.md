# AI Standard Operating Procedure: Layer 5 (Configuration) Audit

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-14
**Purpose:** This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guides an AI assistant in performing a comprehensive audit of Layer 5 (Configuration, Standards, Cross-Cutting Concerns) components within the ScraperSky backend. The goal is to identify deviations from established architectural standards (as defined in the `Layer-5-Configuration_Blueprint.md`) and populate the relevant section of an audit checklist or report.

---

## Introduction: Context from Architectural Truth

This SOP is designed to be used in conjunction with the `Layer-5-Configuration_Blueprint.md` (Version 1.0 or later). Both documents are informed by the overarching architectural standards outlined in `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md` and its supporting documents. The focus is on ensuring the application's foundational configuration, dependencies, middleware, core utilities, and dependency management adhere to defined standards for security, consistency, and maintainability.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & Inputs

Before starting the audit of Layer 5 components, ensure you have access to and have reviewed:

1.  **The Layer 5 Blueprint (Version 1.0 or later):**
    - `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-5-Configuration_Blueprint.md` (Primary standard).
2.  **Core Architectural & Convention Guides:**
    - `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md`.
    - `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/archive-dont-vector/CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`.
    - `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/Q&A_Key_Insights.md`.
3.  **Target for Audit Output:**
    - The specific audit checklist, report document, or section where Layer 5 findings will be recorded.
4.  **Relevant Source Code Files & Artifacts:**
    - Settings files (e.g., `src/core/config.py`).
    - Dependency definition files (e.g., `src/dependencies.py`, `src/auth/dependencies.py`).
    - Main application setup file (e.g., `src/main.py`).
    - Core utility directories (e.g., `src/core/`, `src/utils/`).
    - Project dependency files (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`, `requirements.txt`).
    - Environment variable definitions (`.env` file - **Caution: Do not expose secret values in the audit report**).

---

## 2. Audit Procedure

Audit Layer 5 by examining specific component types and files:

### Step 2.1: Audit Settings Management (e.g., `src/core/config.py`)

1.  **Identify:** Locate the Pydantic `BaseSettings` class(es).
2.  **Analyze Against Blueprint (Section 2.1):**
    - Verify inheritance from `BaseSettings`.
    - Check for type hints on all settings.
    - Confirm loading mechanism (environment variables / `.env`).
    - **Crucially, check for hardcoded secrets.** Secrets must be loaded from the environment.
    - Verify singleton pattern/caching for settings instance.
3.  **Document Gaps:** Note any deviations, especially hardcoded secrets or missing type hints.

### Step 2.2: Audit Dependency Injection Setup (e.g., `src/dependencies.py`)

1.  **Identify:** Locate dependency provider functions (like `get_db`, `get_current_active_user`).
2.  **Analyze Against Blueprint (Section 2.2):**
    - Check for standard function names/signatures.
    - **Verify correct resource management** (e.g., session creation/closing logic in `get_db`).
    - Check for clear return type hints.
    - Ensure functions are designed for reuse.
3.  **Document Gaps:** Note improper resource handling (potential leaks), non-standard functions, or missing type hints.

### Step 2.3: Audit FastAPI App Setup (e.g., `src/main.py`)

1.  **Identify:** Locate `FastAPI()` instantiation, middleware additions, and router inclusions.
2.  **Analyze Against Blueprint (Section 2.3):**
    - Verify clear app initialization.
    - Check middleware configuration and order.
    - Ensure all necessary Layer 3 routers are included.
    - Check lifespan event handlers if present.
3.  **Document Gaps:** Note missing routers, potentially incorrect middleware order, or unclear setup.

### Step 2.4: Audit Core Utilities (e.g., `src/core/`, `src/utils/`)

1.  **Identify:** Scan files for base classes, utility functions, custom exceptions.
2.  **Analyze Against Blueprint (Section 2.4):**
    - **Assess if logic is truly cross-cutting.** Does it belong in a specific higher layer instead?
    - Check for logical grouping/cohesion.
    - Evaluate dependencies â€“ core utilities should ideally not depend on Layers 1-4.
3.  **Document Gaps:** Note misplaced layer-specific logic or utilities with unnecessary dependencies.

### Step 2.5: Audit Dependency Management (`pyproject.toml`/`requirements.txt`)

1.  **Identify:** Locate the primary dependency definition file and its corresponding lock file.
2.  **Analyze Against Blueprint (Section 2.5):**
    - **Check if versions are pinned.** Avoid loose constraints like `>=`.
    - Verify consistency between definition and lock file.
    - (If possible/practical) Check for obviously unused dependencies.
3.  **Document Gaps:** Note unpinned dependencies, inconsistencies, or potentially unused packages.

### Step 2.6: Populate Audit Report / Cheat Sheet (Layer 5 Section)

For each identified gap across all audited components:

1.  **File Path / Component:** Specify the relevant file or component type (e.g., `src/core/config.py`, `Dependency: get_db`, `Dependency Management`).
2.  **Gap Analysis (Technical Debt Identification):**
    - Follow the logic outlined in **Section 4, Step 3 ("Document Technical Debt")** of the `Layer-5-Configuration_Blueprint.md`.
    - Clearly list each deviation identified in Steps 2.1-2.5.
    - **Prioritize flagging security risks (hardcoded secrets) and resource leaks (improper dependency cleanup).**
    - Reference the specific Blueprint section/criterion (e.g., "Blueprint 2.1.4: Hardcoded API key found.", "Blueprint 2.2.2: `get_db` does not ensure session closing.", "Blueprint 2.5.1: Dependency 'X' is not pinned.", "Blueprint 2.4.1: Utility function `Y` contains Layer 4 business logic.").
    - Use `<!-- NEED_CLARITY: [Your question here] -->` if compliance is ambiguous.
3.  **Prescribed Refactoring Actions:**
    - Suggest concrete actions aligned with **Section 4, Step 4 ("Prescribe Refactoring Actions")** of the `Layer-5-Configuration_Blueprint.md`.
    - Focus on fixing high-priority items first.
    - Examples:
      - "Remove hardcoded secret from `config.py` and load from environment variable."
      - "Add `try...finally` block to `get_db` to ensure `session.close()` is called."
      - "Pin version for dependency 'X' in `pyproject.toml`."
      - "Move function `Y` from `src/core/utils.py` to `src/services/z.py`."

### Step 2.7: Review and Finalize

1.  Ensure all key Layer 5 components/files have been assessed.
2.  Verify that the audit report entries are clear, concise, and reference the Layer 5 Blueprint.
3.  Mark any sections with `<!-- STOP_FOR_REVIEW -->` if human review is required, especially regarding potentially misplaced logic or complex dependency issues.

### Step 2.8: Conclude Audit for this Layer

1.  **Audit Focus:** Reiterate that the actions performed under this SOP (Steps 2.1-2.7) are strictly for auditing and documenting findings. The primary output is the comprehensive Layer 5 assessment.
2.  **No Refactoring:** Confirm that no code refactoring is performed during this audit phase. All identified technical debt and refactoring actions are documented for future work by the appropriate persona.
3.  **Output Destination:** Ensure all findings from Step 2.6 (Populate Audit Report / Cheat Sheet) are consolidated into the designated Layer 5 audit report document, typically located in `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Audit Reports Layer 5/Layer5_Configuration_Audit_Report.md` (or a similarly named file specific to this layer).
4.  **Next Steps:** Once all Layer 5 components as outlined in this SOP have been audited and documented, notify the USER that the Layer 5 Configuration audit is complete. Await further instructions for the next audit layer or task.

## 3. Output

- A comprehensive Layer 5 audit report document (e.g., `Layer5_Configuration_Audit_Report.md`) detailing assessments for all relevant configuration components, including identified gaps, technical debt, and prescribed refactoring actions (for future implementation).
