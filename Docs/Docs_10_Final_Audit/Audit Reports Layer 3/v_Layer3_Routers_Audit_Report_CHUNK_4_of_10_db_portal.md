# Layer 3: Routers - AI Audit Summary (Chunk)

_This is a segment of the full Layer 3 audit report, focusing on a specific component._

### 3. Audit of `src/routers/db_portal.py` (Summary)

- **Router:** `src/routers/db_portal.py`
- **Key Findings (based on previous audit checkpoint):**
    - **Response Models:** Observations about missing explicit Pydantic response models for some endpoints. (Blueprint 2.2.2)
    - **Error Handling:** Potential lack of comprehensive error handling for various scenarios. Ensure adherence to Blueprint 2.2.3.5 (standardized error responses using `HTTPException`).
    - **Pydantic Models:** While the router utilizes Pydantic models for request and response validation, ensure this is complete and consistent for all endpoints.
- **Overall:** The primary focus for refactoring should be on implementing explicit Pydantic response models for all endpoints and enhancing error handling to be more robust and standardized.
