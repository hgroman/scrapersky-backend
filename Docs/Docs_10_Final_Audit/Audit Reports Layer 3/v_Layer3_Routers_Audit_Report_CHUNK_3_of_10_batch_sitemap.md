# Layer 3: Routers - AI Audit Summary (Chunk)

_This is a segment of the full Layer 3 audit report, focusing on a specific component._

### 2. Audit of `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py` (Summary)

- **Router:** `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py`
- **Key Findings (based on previous audit checkpoint):**
    - **Response Models:** Similar gaps regarding explicit Pydantic response models as noted in other routers. (Blueprint 2.2.2)
    - **Transaction Management:** Attention needed for transaction management. Ensure all database write operations are explicitly managed. (Blueprint 2.2.3.2)
    - **Pydantic Schemas:** The file emphasizes the use of Pydantic schemas for request and response validation. This is good practice and should be consistently applied throughout.
- **Overall:** Review for consistent use of explicit Pydantic response models and verify robust transaction management for all write operations.
