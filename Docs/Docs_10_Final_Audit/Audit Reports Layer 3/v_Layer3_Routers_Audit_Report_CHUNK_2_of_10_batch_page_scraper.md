# Layer 3: Routers - AI Audit Summary (Chunk)

_This is a segment of the full Layer 3 audit report, focusing on a specific component._

### 1. Audit of `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py` (Summary)

- **Router:** `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`
- **Key Findings (based on previous audit checkpoint):**
    - **Response Models & Type Hints:** Gaps identified in response models; some type hints are too loose (e.g., `Dict[str, Any]`). Adherence to Blueprint 2.2.2 (explicit Pydantic models) is required.
    - **Business Logic Delegation:** Business logic was found directly within router endpoints. This logic should be moved to Layer 4 services as per Blueprint 2.1.1 and 2.2.3.3.
    - **Request Body Types:** Potential use of SQLAlchemy models directly in request bodies instead of dedicated Pydantic schemas. Requests should be validated using Pydantic models.
    - **Transaction Management:** Ensure explicit transaction management (`async with session.begin():`) for all database write operations, as per Blueprint 2.2.3.2.
- **Overall:** This router requires refactoring to improve response model explicitness, delegate business logic to services, ensure Pydantic models are used for requests, and confirm correct transaction handling.
