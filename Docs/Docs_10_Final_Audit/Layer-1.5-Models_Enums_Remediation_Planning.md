## Purpose

This document outlines the prioritized remediation plan for addressing the technical debt identified in the Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs) audit. It provides a systematic approach to implementing fixes, including dependency mapping, effort estimation, and timeline planning.

## Remediation Strategy Overview

### Guiding Principles

1. **Impact-Driven Prioritization:** Focus first on issues that impact system stability, security, or data integrity
2. **Minimize Downstream Disruption:** Plan changes to minimize impacts to dependent code
3. **Test-Driven Remediation:** All changes must include appropriate tests
4. **Documentation Update:** All changes must include updates to relevant documentation
5. **Code Review:** All changes must undergo peer review

### Implementation Approach

1. **Workflow-Based Batching:** Group remediation tasks by workflow to minimize context switching
2. **Shared Infrastructure First:** Address shared model components before workflow-specific ones
3. **Incremental Testing:** Test each change individually before proceeding to the next

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| RISK-01 | *(To be filled)* | *(To be filled)* | *(To be filled)* | *(To be filled)* |

## Validation Strategy

### Testing Approach

1. **Unit Tests:** Ensure each model's behavior is tested independently
2. **Integration Tests:** Verify models work correctly with related components
3. **Validation Tests:** Confirm data validation rules work as expected

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] All models follow naming conventions
- [ ] All ENUMs follow naming conventions
- [ ] All status fields follow the correct pattern
- [ ] No raw SQL is used
- [ ] No tenant IDs directly referenced
- [ ] All relationships are properly defined
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Conclusion

This remediation plan provides a systematic approach to addressing the technical debt identified in the Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs) audit. By following this plan, we will improve the standardization, maintainability, and quality of the ScraperSky backend codebase while minimizing disruption to ongoing development.
