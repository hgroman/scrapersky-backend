# Layer 6: UI Components - Audit Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-21
**Author:** Cascade AI (Audit Plan Architect Persona)
**Purpose:** This document provides a systematic plan for auditing Layer 6 (UI Components) of the ScraperSky backend. It outlines core principles, audit processes, and workflow-specific checklists to ensure compliance with the `Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md`.

---

## 1. Introduction

This audit plan is designed to guide an AI auditor (or human reviewer) in systematically examining the UI components of the ScraperSky application. The primary goal is to identify deviations from established architectural standards, document technical debt, and propose remediation actions. This plan focuses on HTML structure, CSS styling, client-side JavaScript, and static asset organization.

## 2. Reference Documents

The audit process will be guided by the following authoritative documents:

-   **Primary Blueprint:** `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md` (Defines standards for Layer 6)
-   **Audit SOP:** `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-6.3-UI_Components_AI_Audit_SOP.md` (Details audit procedures)
-   **File Matrix:** `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/0-ScraperSky-Comprehensive-Files-By-Layer-And-Workflow.md` (Lists Layer 6 files per workflow)
-   **Core Conventions:** `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` (General naming and structural patterns)
-   **Architectural Truth:** `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md` (Overarching principles)
-   **Clarifications:** `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/Q&A_Key_Insights.md` (Relevant Q&A)

## 3. Core Audit Principles for Layer 6

Derived from the `Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md`, the following principles are central to this audit. Auditors must verify compliance against these for all relevant components:

**A. General UI Principles:**
1.  **Presentation & Interaction:** UI renders data correctly and handles user interactions as expected.
2.  **Modularity:** UI code (HTML, CSS, JS) is organized into reusable and maintainable components/modules.
3.  **Standardization:** Consistent structure, naming, and patterns are enforced (e.g., tab-based interfaces).
4.  **Separation of Concerns:** Presentation logic (HTML/CSS) is separate from client-side interaction logic (JS), and both from backend logic.

**B. HTML Structure & Templating (Blueprint Section 2.1):**
1.  **Semantic HTML:** Use of appropriate HTML5 tags (e.g., `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<button>`).
2.  **Basic Accessibility:** `alt` text for images, label-input associations, keyboard navigability for interactive elements.
3.  **Naming Conventions:** `id` and `class` attributes follow conventions (e.g., `kebab-case`, BEM-like) as per `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`.
4.  **Template Organization:** Logical structure, use of base templates and partials/includes.
5.  **No Inline Styles/Scripts:** Avoid inline `style` attributes and significant inline `<script>` logic; prefer external files.

**C. CSS Styling (Blueprint Section 2.2):**
1.  **External Stylesheets:** All significant CSS in external `.css` files.
2.  **Naming Conventions:** CSS class names follow conventions (e.g., BEM, `kebab-case`) as per `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`.
3.  **Modularity:** CSS organized into logical modules/components.
4.  **Specificity Management:** Avoid overly specific selectors and excessive use of `!important`.
5.  **Readability:** Well-formatted and readable CSS.

**D. Client-Side JavaScript (Blueprint Section 2.3):**
1.  **External Scripts:** All significant JavaScript in external `.js` files.
2.  **Modularity & Patterns:** Code organized into modules/functions; adherence to specified patterns (e.g., for tab UIs from `1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md`).
3.  **No Global Namespace Pollution:** Minimize global variables (use modules, IIFEs).
4.  **DOM Interaction:** Efficient and safe DOM manipulation.
5.  **API Communication:** Centralized or consistent helper for API calls (AJAX/Fetch); robust error handling for API requests.
6.  **Event Handling:** Modern event listener attachment (`addEventListener`).
7.  **Readability & Linting:** Well-formatted, readable code; adherence to linters if configured.
8.  **Basic Security:** Avoid common client-side vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS through improper data rendering).

**E. Static Asset Management (Blueprint Section 2.4):**
1.  **Organized Structure:** Assets in logical subdirectories within `src/static/` (e.g., `css/`, `js/`, `img/`, `fonts/`).
2.  **Correct Linking:** Paths to assets in HTML/CSS are correct.
3.  **Optimization (Recommended):** Minification of CSS/JS, image optimization for production.

## 3.5. Critical Reminders for the Auditor AI (Meta-Guidance)

**To the AI Persona executing this audit plan:** Your successful execution of this audit hinges on internalizing the following operational mandates, derived from prior interactions and project-level best practices:

1.  **Immutable Audit Scope (No Refactoring):**
    -   **Your SOLE responsibility during this audit is to IDENTIFY and DOCUMENT deviations** from the `Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md`.
    -   You are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from making any code changes or refactoring attempts. All findings are for *future* remediation by designated personas/tasks.
    -   Confirm understanding: The output is a *report*, not modified code.

2.  **Authoritative Document Adherence:**
    -   The `Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md` and `Layer-6.3-UI_Components_AI_Audit_SOP.md` are your **primary sources of truth**. Do not deviate or infer beyond their explicit guidance.
    -   Before assessing any component, ensure you have **fully read and understood** the relevant sections of these documents.
    -   All checklist items and findings *must* explicitly reference specific sections/criteria from these documents.

3.  **Precise Reporting & Output:**
    -   All findings must be meticulously documented in the designated audit report: `Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Audit Reports Layer 6/Layer6_UI_Components_Audit_Report.md`.
    -   The report must include a **comprehensive summary** of findings, similar to previous layer audit reports (e.g., Layer 5). This summary should encapsulate key themes, common deviations, and overall compliance status.
    -   Use `<!-- NEED_CLARITY: [Your question here] -->` for ambiguities and `<!-- STOP_FOR_REVIEW -->` for issues requiring human judgment, as per the SOP.

4.  **Workflow Process Awareness (Context for the Audit Plan Architect):**
    -   While *you* (the auditor) may not be registering tasks or journal entries for *this audit's execution*, be aware that all significant project activities (like the creation of *this plan*, or the *completion of your audit*) are tracked via `workflow/tasks.yml` and `workflow/journal_index.yml` according to `workflow/README_WORKFLOW.md`.
    -   This context is provided to reinforce the structured nature of the project.

5.  **Proactive Clarification:**
    -   If any aspect of this plan, the Blueprint, the SOP, or a specific component is unclear, **HALT and ask for clarification** from the USER (Henry Groman) before proceeding. Do not make assumptions.

By internalizing these meta-instructions, you will significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the Layer 6 audit, building upon lessons learned from previous layers.


## 4. Audit Process Overview

The audit will follow the procedures outlined in `Layer-6.3-UI_Components_AI_Audit_SOP.md`:

1.  **Iterate by Workflow:** Address each workflow that has Layer 6 components as listed in `0-ScraperSky-Comprehensive-Files-By-Layer-And-Workflow.md`.
2.  **Identify Component Type:** For each file/component, determine if it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or a static asset.
3.  **Assess Against Principles:** Systematically check the component against ALL relevant Core Audit Principles (Section 3 above) and specific criteria from the `Layer-6.1-UI_Components_Blueprint.md`.
4.  **Document Gaps:** Clearly document all deviations as technical debt in the `Layer6_UI_Components_Audit_Report.md`.
    - Specify file path/component, describe the gap, and reference the violated Blueprint principle/criterion.
    - Use `<!-- NEED_CLARITY: [question] -->` for ambiguities.
5.  **Prescribe Refactoring Actions:** Suggest concrete actions to align with the Blueprint.
    - Use `<!-- STOP_FOR_REVIEW -->` for issues needing human judgment.

## 5. Technical Debt Prioritization Framework

Categorize identified technical debt as follows:

-   **High:**
    -   Significant accessibility violations.
    -   Obvious client-side security vulnerabilities (e.g., clear XSS vectors in JS).
    -   Major structural problems breaking UI functionality or significantly impairing usability.
    -   Complete disregard for core modularity (e.g., monolithic JS files for complex UIs, extensive inline scripting/styling).
    -   Failure to implement critical API error handling in JS.
-   **Medium:**
    -   Inconsistent naming conventions (HTML, CSS, JS) making code hard to follow.
    -   Moderate modularity issues (e.g., some large functions, CSS not well componentized).
    -   Disorganized static asset structure complicating maintenance.
    -   Missing non-critical API error handling or feedback to the user.
    -   Minor accessibility issues not blocking core functionality.
-   **Low:**
    -   Minor readability issues in code (formatting, comments).
    -   Minor deviations from naming conventions if general adherence is present.
    -   Lack of asset optimization (minification, image compression) if not causing performance issues.
    -   Opportunities for code refinement not affecting correctness or major maintainability.

## 6. Workflow-Specific Audit Checklists

For each workflow, audit the specified Layer 6 components. The primary HTML structure for tabs is assumed to be within a main template file (e.g., `src/templates/index.html` or similar, which contains elements with the specified 'HTML Tab ID').
