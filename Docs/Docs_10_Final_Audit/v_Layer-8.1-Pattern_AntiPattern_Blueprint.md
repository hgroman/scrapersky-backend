## 1. Core Principle(s) for Layer 8: Architectural Compliance & Pattern Enforcement

Layer 8 is designated as the "Pattern-AntiPattern Weaver". Its core principles are:

- **Define Compliance:** To serve as the definitive source for approved architectural patterns and forbidden anti-patterns.
- **Enforce Standards:** To actively audit and enforce compliance with established patterns across all layers.
- **Knowledge Synthesis:** To synthesize lessons from incidents and successes into new, codified patterns and anti-patterns.
- **Architectural Integrity:** To act as the immune system of the architecture, identifying and flagging deviations before they become systemic problems.

## 2. Standard Pattern: Compliance Frameworks

This is the sole and mandatory pattern for Layer 8.

### 2.1. Definition & Scope

- **Purpose:** To define, document, and provide tools for verifying architectural patterns.
- **Location & File Naming:**
  - Pattern Definitions: `Docs/01_Architectural_Guidance/patterns/{pattern_name}.md`
  - Anti-Pattern Definitions: `Docs/01_Architectural_Guidance/anti_patterns/{anti_pattern_name}.md`
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Maintaining the library of approved patterns.
  - Maintaining the library of known anti-patterns.
  - Providing audit scripts or checklists for automated and manual compliance verification.

### 2.2. Key Compliance Criteria for Layer 8 Components

- **Clarity:** Patterns and anti-patterns must be documented with clear examples, rationale, and remediation steps.
- **Atomicity:** Each document should describe a single, atomic pattern or anti-pattern.
- **Traceability:** All patterns and anti-patterns should be linked back to constitutional principles or specific incidents.

## 3. Audit & Assessment Guidance

Auditing against Layer 8 involves using its defined patterns to audit all other layers. The L8 Guardian's role is to provide the tools and knowledge for other guardians and The Architect to perform these audits effectively.
