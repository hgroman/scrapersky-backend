# Layer 1: Models & ENUMs - Audit Report (Chunk)

_This is a segment of the full Layer 1 audit report, focusing on a specific component._

### File: `src/models/base.py`

This file defines the SQLAlchemy declarative base and a common `BaseModel` mixin. No direct table models or ENUMs are defined here. The `model_to_dict` utility function is out of scope for Layer 1 audit.

#### 1. Component: `Base = declarative_base()`
- **Component Name:** `SQLAlchemy Declarative Base`
- **Current State Summary:** Standard SQLAlchemy `declarative_base()` instantiation.
- **Gap Analysis (Technical Debt Identification):**
    - **Blueprint 2.1.1 (ORM Exclusivity):** Compliant. Uses SQLAlchemy.
    - **Blueprint 2.1.2 (Declarative Base):** Compliant. Uses `declarative_base()`.
- **Prescribed Refactoring Actions:** None.

#### 2. Component: `class BaseModel` (Mixin)
- **Component Name:** `CLASS: BaseModel (Mixin)`
- **Current State Summary:** A mixin class providing `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` columns for other models.
- **Gap Analysis (Technical Debt Identification):**
    - **Blueprint 2.1.3 (Common Base Model/Mixin):** Compliant. The file provides a `BaseModel` mixin.
    - **Blueprint 2.1.3.1 (Standard Fields in Mixin):** All fields (`id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) are compliant with type, primary key, default, nullability, and auto-update requirements.
- **Prescribed Refactoring Actions:** None. `BaseModel` is fully compliant.
