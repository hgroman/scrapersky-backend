# Layer 3: Routers - Audit Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Prepared by:** Cascade Router Guardian (AI Auditor)

## 1. Introduction and Objectives

This document outlines the plan for conducting a systematic audit of Layer 3 (API Routers) within the ScraperSky backend application. The primary objective is to assess the compliance of existing routers with the established architectural standards, naming conventions, and operational best practices defined in `Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md`.

The audit aims to:
- Identify and document any deviations from the Layer 3 Blueprint.
- Catalog instances of technical debt, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement.
- Ensure routers correctly handle dependencies, request/response schemas, and error propagation.
- Verify adherence to security best practices within the router layer.
- Produce a comprehensive `Layer-3.4-Routers_Audit_Report.md` detailing all findings.

## 2. Scope of Audit

The audit will cover all FastAPI router files located in the `src/routers/` directory. Based on the current project structure, the following files are in scope:

- [src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py](cci:7://file:///Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py:0:0-0:0)

Any new router files added during the audit period will also be included. [__init__.py](cci:7://file:///Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/src/routers/__init__.py:0:0-0:0) files are excluded unless they contain specific router logic.

## 3. Guiding Documents & Personas

### 3.1. Guiding Documents:
The audit will be performed in strict adherence to the principles and procedures outlined in the following documents:
- **`Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md`**: Defines the architectural standards, design patterns, and compliance criteria for Layer 3 Routers. This is the primary reference for evaluating router implementations.
- **`Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Layer-3.3-Routers_AI_Audit_SOP.md`**: Details the step-by-step Standard Operating Procedure for the AI to conduct the Layer 3 audit.
- **`Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/archive-dont-vector/CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`**: Provides general project-wide conventions relevant to routers.
- **`Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/Q&A_Key_Insights.md`**: Contains answers to specific architectural questions that may impact router design.

### 3.2. Auditor Persona:
- **Cascade Router Guardian**: This AI persona will be activated to conduct the Layer 3 audit, specializing in API router design, FastAPI best practices, and adherence to ScraperSky's architectural standards for routers.

## 4. Audit Workflow & Methodology

The audit will follow the steps detailed in `Layer-3.3-Routers_AI_Audit_SOP.md`. A high-level overview of the workflow is as follows:

1.  **Preparation:**
    *   Activate the **Cascade Router Guardian** persona.
    *   Thoroughly review all Guiding Documents, especially the `Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md` to internalize all audit principles.
    *   Confirm the list of router files in scope.

2.  **Execution (Iterative per Router File):**
    *   For each router file identified in Section 2 (Scope):
        *   **Static Code Analysis:** Review the router's structure, endpoint definitions, dependency injections, request/response model usage, error handling, and adherence to naming conventions.
        *   **Blueprint Compliance Check:** Systematically compare the router's implementation against each principle and standard defined in `Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md`.
        *   **Identify Gaps & Issues:** Note all deviations, inconsistencies, potential bugs, areas of technical debt, and non-compliance.
        *   **Categorize Findings:** Classify findings by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) and associate them with specific Blueprint principles.
        *   **Document Findings:** Record detailed findings for the current router file in the `Layer-3.4-Routers_Audit_Report.md`. Use tags like `<!-- NEED_CLARITY -->` or `<!-- STOP_FOR_REVIEW -->` as appropriate.

3.  **Reporting & Review:**
    *   Consolidate all raw findings for each router into the main body of the `Layer-3.4-Routers_Audit_Report.md`.
    *   Structure the main body of the report according to the template specified in the SOP, including detailed breakdowns per router, and overall compliance status.
    *   **Generate and prepend an AI Audit Summary:** Following the consolidation of detailed findings, the AI Auditor (Cascade Router Guardian) will generate a comprehensive summary. This summary will:
        *   Be prepended to the `Layer-3.4-Routers_Audit_Report.md`.
        *   Provide an overall assessment of Layer 3 router compliance.
        *   Highlight key findings, categorized by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Minor).
        *   Offer actionable recommendations for remediation.
        *   Mirror the structure and detail of the summary provided for the Layer 2 Schema audit.
    *   Submit the completed audit report (including the prepended summary) for USER review.

## 5. Deliverables

The primary deliverable of this audit will be:

1.  **`Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/Audit Reports Layer 3/Layer-3.4-Routers_Audit_Report.md`**:
    A comprehensive document that includes:
    *   **A prepended AI-Generated Audit Summary:** This detailed summary covers overall assessment, key findings by severity, and actionable recommendations (as described in the Audit Workflow).
    *   The main body of the report, containing:
        *   Overall compliance status of Layer 3 Routers.
        *   Detailed findings for each audited router file, referencing specific Blueprint principles.
        *   Identified technical debt, anti-patterns, and areas for improvement.
        *   Any `NEED_CLARITY` or `STOP_FOR_REVIEW` tags requiring USER attention.

## 6. Timeline

The audit will commence upon approval of this plan and proceed iteratively through each router file. The AI will provide progress updates as appropriate.

## 7. Assumptions

- The Guiding Documents (`Layer-3.1-Routers_Blueprint.md` and `Layer-3.3-Routers_AI_Audit_SOP.md`) are up-to-date and represent the current standards.
- Access to the codebase and necessary documentation will be available.
