# Layer 4 Audit Report: WF6-SitemapImport

**Workflow:** WF6-SitemapImport
**Audit Date:** 2025-05-20
**Auditor:** AI Assistant (Cascade)

## 1. Executive Summary

The `WF6-SitemapImport` workflow represents the background processing stage for sitemap files. Its Layer 4 components, `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py` and `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`, are shared with the `WF5-SitemapCuration` workflow (which handles the queuing of sitemaps).

The audit confirms these components are generally well-structured. The scheduler correctly picks up queued items, and the service handles the parsing and page creation. However, a **critical violation** of architectural standards persists: the `sitemap_import_service.py` incorrectly uses `tenant_id` when creating `Page` records, contradicting the project-wide removal of tenant isolation (`09-TENANT_ISOLATION_REMOVED.md`).

## 2. Scope of Audit

This audit covers the Layer 4 (Services and Schedulers) components central to the `WF6-SitemapImport` workflow. The primary files reviewed (also as part of WF5 audit) were:

- `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py`
- `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`
- `src/main.py` (for scheduler registration context)

## 3. Audit Findings

(Findings are identical to those for these components in the `WF5-SitemapCuration_Layer4_Audit_Report.md` due to shared module responsibility)

### 3.1. `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py` (Scheduler)

- **Functionality:** Monitors `SitemapFile` records where `sitemap_import_status == SitemapImportProcessStatusEnum.Queued`. Uses `run_job_loop` SDK component.
- **Session Management:** Compliant (via `run_job_loop` SDK).
- **Processing Invocation:** Calls `SitemapImportService.process_single_sitemap_file`.
- **Registration:** Compliant. `setup_sitemap_import_scheduler()` is called in `src/main.py`.
- **File Naming:** Acceptable (`sitemap_import_scheduler.py`).
- **Status:** `Compliant`

### 3.2. `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py` (Processing Service)

- **Functionality:** Processes a single sitemap file: fetches content, parses URLs, creates `Page` records, updates `SitemapFile` status.
- **Transaction-Awareness:** Compliant (accepts session from `run_job_loop`, handles own commit/rollback for single item processing).
- **CRITICAL VIOLATION - Tenant ID Usage:**
    - **Issue:** Uses `sitemap_file.tenant_id` when creating new `Page` records.
    - **Impact:** Violates `09-TENANT_ISOLATION_REMOVED.md`.
- **Status Updates:** Compliant.
- **Status:** `Partially Compliant (Critical Violation)`

## 4. Identified Gaps & Technical Debt

(Identical to those identified for these components in the WF5 audit)

1.  **CRITICAL: Tenant ID Usage in `sitemap_import_service.py` (TD-WF6-001, effectively same as TD-WF5-001)**
    - **Description:** The service populates `tenant_id` in new `Page` records.
    - **Risk:** Architectural inconsistency, data model complications.
    - **Affected Standard:** `09-TENANT_ISOLATION_REMOVED.md`.

## 5. Recommended Actions & Remediation

(Identical to those recommended for these components in the WF5 audit)

1.  **Address TD-WF6-001 (Critical - Tenant ID Usage):**
    - **Action:** Modify `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py` to remove any reference to or usage of `sitemap_file.tenant_id` when creating `Page` records.
    - **Verification:** Confirm `Page` records are created without `tenant_id` and this aligns with the `Page` model/schema.
    - **Priority:** High.

## 6. Conclusion

The Layer 4 components for `WF6-SitemapImport` are functional but carry the same critical `tenant_id` violation found in `WF5-SitemapCuration` due to shared code. Remediation of this issue in `sitemap_import_service.py` will resolve it for both workflows.
