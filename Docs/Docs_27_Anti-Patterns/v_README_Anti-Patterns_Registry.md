# ScraperSky Anti-Patterns Registry

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** 2025-07-27  
**Purpose:** Institutional knowledge registry for preventing critical system failures  
**Scope:** System-wide anti-patterns affecting business workflows and AI collaboration  

---

## Purpose Statement

This registry maintains institutional memory of critical failures, anti-patterns, and prevention measures across the ScraperSky system. It serves as a knowledge base for all AI partners, developers, and system maintainers to prevent recurring incidents and maintain operational excellence.

**Core Principle:** Learn from history to build resilient systems and collaborative practices.

**AI Integration:** This registry is vectorized and searchable. AI assistants MUST query before making changes to prevent repeating documented failures.

## Anti-Pattern Classification System

### Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL:** Business process disruption, data corruption, significant productivity loss
- **HIGH:** Workflow failures, integration issues, performance degradation
- **MEDIUM:** Operational inefficiencies, maintenance burden, minor data issues
- **LOW:** Code quality issues, documentation problems, minor user experience impacts

### Categories
- **AI Collaboration:** Issues arising from AI-human collaboration patterns
- **Business Process:** Violations of business workflow integrity
- **Architectural:** System design and component interaction failures
- **Data Quality:** Data corruption, validation, and integrity issues
- **Integration:** Cross-workflow and cross-layer coordination failures

---

## AI Assistant Instructions

### MANDATORY Pre-Change Protocol

**Before making ANY code changes, AI assistants MUST:**

1. **Query Anti-Patterns by Context:**
   ```yaml
   workflow: "[Target Workflow]"
   layer: "[Target Layer]"
   component: "[Target Component]"
   technology: "[Technology Being Modified]"
   ```

2. **Check Consultation Requirements:**
   - If `consultation_required` is populated, STOP and request human review
   - If `danger_level: "WORKFLOW_BREAKING"`, STOP and request approval
   - If `severity: "CRITICAL"` + same component, STOP and consult documentation

3. **Verify Against Patterns:**
   - Review "The Correct Pattern" section in relevant anti-patterns
   - Ensure proposed changes don't recreate documented failures
   - Follow prevention measures from related anti-patterns

### YAML Metadata System

Each anti-pattern document contains structured metadata for AI discovery:

```yaml
# Architecture Location (WHERE)
workflow: "WF1-WF5 or CROSS_WORKFLOW"
layer: "LAYER1-LAYER7"
component: "scheduler|router|service|model"

# Business Context (WHY IT MATTERS)
business_process: "What business function is affected"
affects_handoff: ["WF1->WF2", "WF3->WF4"]
user_facing: true|false

# AI Context (WHEN TO CONSULT)
danger_level: "WORKFLOW_BREAKING|DATA_CORRUPTION|PERFORMANCE|MINOR"
consultation_required: ["Guardian_Document", "Architecture_Docs"]
```

### Creating New Anti-Patterns

1. **Use the Template:** Copy `TEMPLATE_Anti-Pattern.md`
2. **Fill ALL Required Fields:** Every YAML field marked "REQUIRED"
3. **Follow Naming Convention:** `YYYYMMDD_Pattern_Name_SEVERITY.md`
4. **Update This Registry:** Add entry to appropriate severity table
5. **Tag Appropriately:** 5-10 searchable tags for AI discovery

## Template Usage

### For AI Assistants

**When documenting a new anti-pattern:**

1. Copy `TEMPLATE_Anti-Pattern.md` to new file
2. Replace ALL placeholder text:
   - `[Workflow Name]` → Actual workflow (WF1, WF2, etc.)
   - `[SEVERITY]` → CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
   - `YYYYMMDD` → Actual date (20250730)
   - `XXX` → Sequential number (001, 002, etc.)

3. **YAML Metadata Rules:**
   - `anti_pattern_id`: Must be unique (AP-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
   - `workflow`: Must match ScraperSky workflow names
   - `layer`: Must match 7-layer architecture (LAYER1-LAYER7)
   - `danger_level`: Determines AI blocking behavior
   - `tags`: Include technology, component, and failure mode

4. **Content Requirements:**
   - Include actual code examples (wrong vs. right)
   - Specify exact error messages for detection
   - List concrete prevention measures
   - Reference existing documentation

### For Human Reviewers

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] YAML metadata complete and accurate
- [ ] Anti-pattern ID follows format and is unique
- [ ] Code examples are actual, not hypothetical
- [ ] Detection signals are specific and actionable
- [ ] Prevention measures are concrete and implementable
- [ ] References link to existing documentation
- [ ] Registry table updated with new entry

## Anti-Pattern Documentation Standard

### Required Elements
Each anti-pattern document must include:

1. **Header Information**
   - Anti-Pattern ID (AP-YYYYMMDD-XXX)
   - Date occurred, workflow affected, severity
   - Classification and category

2. **Anti-Pattern Summary**
   - Pattern name, description, risk level
   - Clear identification of what went wrong

3. **Incident Details**
   - What happened, root cause analysis
   - Technical details and cascade effects

4. **Detection Signals**
   - Technical indicators, behavioral patterns
