# WF2 Staging Editor Curation - Guardian Impact Analysis

## CRITICAL OPERATING MODE: WF2 ANALYSIS ONLY - NO EXECUTION

**⚠️ MANDATORY CONSTRAINT: You are operating in PLANNING MODE ONLY for WF2 Staging Editor Curation workflow. Do NOT execute any code changes, file modifications, or remediation actions. Focus ONLY on WF2 - do not analyze other workflows.**

## Your Specific Mission: WF2 Guardian Impact Assessment
Recent Guardian architectural changes (ENUM centralization, BaseModel compliance, schema layer creation) have transformed the codebase foundation. Your mission is to analyze ONLY the WF2 Staging Editor Curation workflow and identify any misalignments between the current code and the canonical specification.

## WF2 Canonical Specification Summary
Based on `v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml`, WF2 involves these specific files across all 7 layers:

**Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs):**
- `src/models/place.py` (Place model + PlaceStatusEnum + DeepScanStatusEnum)
- `src/models/base.py` (SQLAlchemy base model class)
- `src/models/local_business.py` (LocalBusiness model)
- `src/models/api_models.py` (PlaceStagingStatusEnum - check if moved to enums.py)

**Layer 2 (Schemas):**
- Schema files for PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest validation (check for api_models.py references)

**Layer 3 (Routers):**
- `src/routers/places_staging.py` (PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status)

**Layer 4 (Services):**
- `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` (background task scheduling)
- `src/services/places_deep_service.py` (deep scan processing)

**Layer 5 (Configuration):**
- `docker-compose.yml`, `src/config/settings.py` (scheduler configuration)

**Layer 6 (UI Components):**
- `static/js/staging-editor-tab.js`

**Layer 7 (Testing):**
- Any test files related to WF2 components

## Your Primary Tool: Semantic Search (MANDATORY)
The WF2 canonical documentation has been embedded into a vector database. This is your most powerful tool for understanding WF2. Use semantic queries extensively to educate yourself on the intended state.

**Execute semantic queries from project root:**
```bash
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "Your natural language question about WF2"
```

## Guardian Impact Analysis Protocol

### Step 0: WF2 Semantic Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
**Before analyzing any code, use semantic search to understand WF2:**

```bash
# 1. Get WF2 canonical specification
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 Staging Editor canonical specification workflow overview"

# 2. Understand WF2 ENUM requirements  
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 PlaceStatusEnum DeepScanStatusEnum PlaceStagingStatusEnum values location"

# 3. Find WF2 schema requirements
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema validation models"

# 4. Discover WF2 file dependencies
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 Staging Editor files routers services models dependencies"

# 5. Understand WF2 workflow connections
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 workflow connections WF1 WF3 handoff interfaces"
```

### Step 1: ENUM Analysis (Layer 1)
**Check these specific files:**
- `src/models/place.py` - Should PlaceStatusEnum and DeepScanStatusEnum be moved to `src/models/enums.py`?
- `src/models/api_models.py` - Should PlaceStagingStatusEnum be moved to centralized location?

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does `src/models/place.py` still define PlaceStatusEnum and DeepScanStatusEnum locally?
2. Does `src/models/api_models.py` still exist and define PlaceStagingStatusEnum?
3. Are ENUM values preserved: PlaceStatusEnum `[New, Selected, Rejected, Processed]`, DeepScanStatusEnum `[None, Queued, InProgress, Complete, Error]`?
4. Are WF2 files using new centralized ENUM import patterns?

### Step 2: Schema Analysis (Layer 2)
**Check for:**
- References to deleted `src/models/api_models.py` in WF2 files
- PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema location and imports
- New schema imports from `src/schemas/` directory

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are WF2 components still importing from `api_models.py`?
2. Where should PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema be located now?
3. Are schema imports updated in `src/routers/places_staging.py`?

### Step 3: Router Analysis (Layer 3)
**Check this specific file:**
- `src/routers/places_staging.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are import statements updated for new ENUM/schema locations?
2. Does the endpoint `PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status` still work?
3. Is PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest validation using the new schema structure?
4. Are PlaceStatusEnum, DeepScanStatusEnum, and PlaceStagingStatusEnum imports updated?

### Step 4: Service Layer Analysis (Layer 4)
**Check these specific WF2 files:**
- `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
- `src/services/places_deep_service.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are ENUM imports updated to use `src.models.enums`?
2. Do services still reference the correct Place model and ENUMs?
3. Are DeepScanStatusEnum references working correctly?

### Step 5: Model Integration Analysis (Layer 1)
**Check model relationships:**
- `src/models/place.py` (primary model)
- `src/models/local_business.py` (produced for WF3)
- `src/models/base.py` (inheritance)

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are all models using proper BaseModel inheritance?
2. Are foreign key relationships intact after Guardian changes?
3. Are ENUM field definitions using centralized ENUMs?

### Step 6: Integration Points Analysis
**Check WF2's interfaces:**
- **WF1 → WF2:** Consumes from `places_staging` table with `status=PlaceStatusEnum.New`
- **WF2 → WF3:** Produces to `local_businesses` table with `status=PlaceStatusEnum.Selected`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does WF2 still read from `places_staging` with correct ENUM values?
2. Does WF2 still write to `local_businesses` table correctly?
3. Are status handoff mechanisms still functional with centralized ENUMs?

```

## Safety Constraints
- **🚫 ANALYZE ONLY WF2** - Do not examine other workflows
- **🚫 NO CODE EXECUTION** - Read-only analysis
- **🚫 NO FILE MODIFICATIONS** - Planning only
- **✅ FOCUS ON GUARDIAN IMPACT** - How did ENUM/schema changes affect WF2?
- **✅ USE WF2 CANONICAL SPEC** - Reference `v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml` as truth

**Start your analysis by examining `src/models/place.py` and `src/models/api_models.py` for ENUM centralization impact on WF2.**
