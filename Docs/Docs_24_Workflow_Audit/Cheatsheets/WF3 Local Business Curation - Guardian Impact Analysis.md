# WF3 Local Business Curation - Guardian Impact Analysis

## CRITICAL OPERATING MODE: WF3 ANALYSIS ONLY - NO EXECUTION

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CONSTRAINT: You are operating in PLANNING MODE ONLY for WF3 Local Business Curation workflow. Do NOT execute any code changes, file modifications, or remediation actions. Focus ONLY on WF3 - do not analyze other workflows.**

## Your Specific Mission: WF3 Guardian Impact Assessment
Recent Guardian architectural changes (ENUM centralization, BaseModel compliance, schema layer creation) have transformed the codebase foundation. Your mission is to analyze ONLY the WF3 Local Business Curation workflow and identify any misalignments between the current code and the canonical specification.

## Your Primary Tool: Semantic Search (MANDATORY)
The WF3 canonical documentation has been embedded into a vector database. This is your most powerful tool for understanding WF3. Use semantic queries extensively to educate yourself on the intended state.

**Execute semantic queries from project root:**
```bash
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "Your natural language question about WF3"
```

## Guardian Impact Analysis Protocol

### Step 0: WF3 Semantic Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
**Before analyzing any code, use semantic search to understand WF3:**

```bash
# 1. Get WF3 canonical specification
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF3 Local Business Curation canonical specification workflow overview"

# 2. Understand WF3 ENUM requirements  
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF3 PlaceStatusEnum DomainExtractionStatusEnum LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest values location"

# 3. Find WF3 schema requirements
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF3 LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema validation api_models migration"

# 4. Discover WF3 file dependencies
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF3 Local Business files models routers services dependencies all layers"

# 5. Understand WF3 workflow connections
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF3 workflow connections WF2 WF4 handoff local_businesses interface"
```

### Step 1: ENUM Analysis (Layer 1)
**After semantic research, check these specific files:**
- `src/models/local_business.py` - Should DomainExtractionStatusEnum be moved to `src/models/enums.py`?
- `src/models/place.py` - Should PlaceStatusEnum be moved to centralized location?
- `src/models/domain.py` - Any ENUMs that need centralization?
- `src/models/api_models.py` - Should LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest be moved?

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does `src/models/local_business.py` still define DomainExtractionStatusEnum locally?
2. Does `src/models/place.py` still define PlaceStatusEnum locally (reused by WF3)?
3. Does `src/models/api_models.py` still exist and define LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest?
4. Are ENUM values preserved: PlaceStatusEnum `[New, Selected, Rejected, Processed]`, DomainExtractionStatusEnum `[None, Queued, InProgress, Complete, Error]`?
5. Are WF3 files using new centralized ENUM import patterns?

### Step 2: Schema Analysis (Layer 2)
**Check for:**
- References to deleted `src/models/api_models.py` in WF3 files
- LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema location and imports
- New schema imports from `src/schemas/` directory

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are WF3 components still importing from `api_models.py`?
2. Where should LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema be located now?
3. Are schema imports updated in `src/routers/local_businesses.py`?

### Step 3: Router Analysis (Layer 3)
**Check this specific file:**
- `src/routers/local_businesses.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are import statements updated for new ENUM/schema locations?
2. Does the endpoint `PUT /api/v3/local-businesses/status` still work?
3. Is LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest validation using the new schema structure?
4. Are PlaceStatusEnum and DomainExtractionStatusEnum imports updated?
5. Is the Dual-Status Update logic still working with centralized ENUMs?

### Step 4: Service Layer Analysis (Layer 4)
**Check these specific WF3 files:**
- `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` (background task scheduling)
- `src/services/business_to_domain_service.py` (domain extraction processing)

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are ENUM imports updated to use `src.models.enums`?
2. Do services still reference the correct LocalBusiness and Domain models?
3. Are DomainExtractionStatusEnum references working correctly?
4. Is the scheduler still finding queued items with centralized ENUMs?

### Step 5: Model Integration Analysis (Layer 1)
**Check model relationships:**
- `src/models/local_business.py` (primary model)
- `src/models/domain.py` (produced during extraction)
- `src/models/base.py` (inheritance)

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are all models using proper BaseModel inheritance?
2. Are foreign key relationships intact after Guardian changes?
3. Are ENUM field definitions using centralized ENUMs?
4. Is the LocalBusiness-Domain relationship working correctly?

### Step 6: Integration Points Analysis
**Check WF3's interfaces:**
- **WF2 ‚Üí WF3:** Consumes from `local_businesses` table with `status=PlaceStatusEnum.Selected`
- **WF3 ‚Üí WF4:** Produces to `local_businesses` table with `domain_extraction_status=DomainExtractionStatusEnum.Queued`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does WF3 still read from `local_businesses` with correct ENUM values?
2. Does WF3 still update `domain_extraction_status` correctly for WF4?
3. Are status handoff mechanisms still functional with centralized ENUMs?
4. Is the domain extraction trigger pattern working?

### Step 7: Background Processing Analysis
**Check background task components:**
- Background scheduler polling for queued items
- Domain extraction service processing
- Status updates and error handling

**Questions to answer:**
1. Is the scheduler still finding items with `domain_extraction_status=Queued`?
2. Are status updates using centralized ENUM values?
3. Is error handling still setting correct ENUM values?

## Safety Constraints
- **üö´ ANALYZE ONLY WF3** - Do not examine other workflows
- **üö´ NO CODE EXECUTION** - Read-only analysis
- **üö´ NO FILE MODIFICATIONS** - Planning only
- **‚úÖ START WITH SEMANTIC RESEARCH** - Use vectorized docs first
- **‚úÖ FOCUS ON GUARDIAN IMPACT** - How did ENUM/schema changes affect WF3?
- **‚úÖ USE WF3 CANONICAL SPEC** - Reference vectorized documentation as truth

**Start by running the semantic queries in Step 0, then proceed with code analysis.**
