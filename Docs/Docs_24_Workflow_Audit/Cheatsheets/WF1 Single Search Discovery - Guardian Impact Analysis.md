# WF1 Single Search Discovery - Guardian Impact Analysis

## CRITICAL OPERATING MODE: WF1 ANALYSIS ONLY - NO EXECUTION

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CONSTRAINT: You are operating in PLANNING MODE ONLY for WF1 Single Search Discovery workflow. Do NOT execute any code changes, file modifications, or remediation actions. Focus ONLY on WF1 - do not analyze other workflows.**

## Your Specific Mission: WF1 Guardian Impact Assessment
Recent Guardian architectural changes (ENUM centralization, BaseModel compliance, schema layer creation) have transformed the codebase foundation. Your mission is to analyze ONLY the WF1 Single Search Discovery workflow and identify any misalignments between the current code and the canonical specification.

## Your Primary Tool: Semantic Search (MANDATORY)
The WF1 canonical documentation has been embedded into a vector database. This is your most powerful tool for understanding WF1. Use semantic queries extensively to educate yourself on the intended state.

**Execute semantic queries from project root:**
```bash
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "Your natural language question about WF1"
```

## Guardian Impact Analysis Protocol

### Step 0: WF1 Semantic Discovery (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
**Before analyzing any code, use semantic search to understand WF1:**

```bash
# 1. Get WF1 canonical specification
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF1 Single Search Discovery canonical specification workflow overview"

# 2. Understand WF1 ENUM requirements  
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF1 PlaceStatusEnum values location place model requirements"

# 3. Find WF1 schema requirements
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF1 Single Search schema validation models api_models migration"

# 4. Discover WF1 file dependencies
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF1 Single Search files models routers services dependencies all layers"

# 5. Understand WF1 workflow connections
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF1 workflow connections WF2 handoff places_staging interface"
```

### Step 1: ENUM Analysis (Layer 1)
**After semantic research, check these specific files:**
- `src/models/place.py` - Should PlaceStatusEnum be moved to `src/models/enums.py`?
- `src/models/place_search.py` - Any ENUMs that need centralization?

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does `src/models/place.py` still define PlaceStatusEnum locally?
2. If Guardian centralized ENUMs, are WF1 files using the new import pattern?
3. Are ENUM values still `[New, Selected, Rejected, Processed]` as specified?

### Step 2: Schema Analysis (Layer 2)
**Check for:**
- References to deleted `src/models/api_models.py` in WF1 files
- New schema imports from `src/schemas/` directory
- Input validation schemas for the search endpoint

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are WF1 components still importing from `api_models.py`?
2. What schemas should be in `src/schemas/` for WF1?
3. Are schema imports updated in `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`?

### Step 3: Service Layer Analysis (Layer 4)
**Check these specific WF1 files:**
- `src/services/places/places_search_service.py`
- `src/services/places/places_storage_service.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are ENUM imports updated to use `src.models.enums`?
2. Are schema imports updated to use `src.schemas.`?
3. Do the services still reference the correct models and ENUMs?

### Step 4: Router Analysis (Layer 3)
**Check this specific file:**
- `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are import statements updated for new ENUM/schema locations?
2. Does the endpoint `POST /api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/places` still work?
3. Are schema validations using the new schema structure?

### Step 5: Integration Points Analysis
**Check WF1's interface with WF2:**
- Does WF1 still write to `places_staging` table?
- Does it set `status=PlaceStatusEnum.New` correctly?
- Is the handoff to WF2 still functional?

## Safety Constraints
- **üö´ ANALYZE ONLY WF1** - Do not examine other workflows
- **üö´ NO CODE EXECUTION** - Read-only analysis
- **üö´ NO FILE MODIFICATIONS** - Planning only
- **‚úÖ START WITH SEMANTIC RESEARCH** - Use vectorized docs first
- **‚úÖ FOCUS ON GUARDIAN IMPACT** - How did ENUM/schema changes affect WF1?
- **‚úÖ USE WF1 CANONICAL SPEC** - Reference vectorized documentation as truth

**Start by running the semantic queries in Step 0, then proceed with code analysis.**# WF2 Staging Editor Curation - Guardian Impact Analysis

## CRITICAL OPERATING MODE: WF2 ANALYSIS ONLY - NO EXECUTION

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY CONSTRAINT: You are operating in PLANNING MODE ONLY for WF2 Staging Editor Curation workflow. Do NOT execute any code changes, file modifications, or remediation actions. Focus ONLY on WF2 - do not analyze other workflows.**

## Your Specific Mission: WF2 Guardian Impact Assessment
Recent Guardian architectural changes (ENUM centralization, BaseModel compliance, schema layer creation) have transformed the codebase foundation. Your mission is to analyze ONLY the WF2 Staging Editor Curation workflow and identify any misalignments between the current code and the canonical specification.

## WF2 Canonical Specification Summary
Based on `v_8_WF2_CANONICAL.yaml`, WF2 involves these specific files across all 7 layers:

**Layer 1 (Models & ENUMs):**
- `src/models/place.py` (Place model + PlaceStatusEnum + DeepScanStatusEnum)
- `src/models/base.py` (SQLAlchemy base model class)
- `src/models/local_business.py` (LocalBusiness model)
- `src/models/api_models.py` (PlaceStagingStatusEnum - check if moved to enums.py)

**Layer 2 (Schemas):**
- Schema files for PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest validation (check for api_models.py references)

**Layer 3 (Routers):**
- `src/routers/places_staging.py` (PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status)

**Layer 4 (Services):**
- `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` (background task scheduling)
- `src/services/places_deep_service.py` (deep scan processing)

**Layer 5 (Configuration):**
- `docker-compose.yml`, `src/config/settings.py` (scheduler configuration)

**Layer 6 (UI Components):**
- `static/js/staging-editor-tab.js`

**Layer 7 (Testing):**
- Any test files related to WF2 components

# 5. Understand WF2 workflow connections
python Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "WF2 workflow connections WF1 WF3 handoff interfaces"
```

### Step 1: ENUM Analysis (Layer 1)
**Check these specific files:**
- `src/models/place.py` - Should PlaceStatusEnum and DeepScanStatusEnum be moved to `src/models/enums.py`?
- `src/models/api_models.py` - Should PlaceStagingStatusEnum be moved to centralized location?

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does `src/models/place.py` still define PlaceStatusEnum and DeepScanStatusEnum locally?
2. Does `src/models/api_models.py` still exist and define PlaceStagingStatusEnum?
3. Are ENUM values preserved: PlaceStatusEnum `[New, Selected, Rejected, Processed]`, DeepScanStatusEnum `[None, Queued, InProgress, Complete, Error]`?
4. Are WF2 files using new centralized ENUM import patterns?

### Step 2: Schema Analysis (Layer 2)
**Check for:**
- References to deleted `src/models/api_models.py` in WF2 files
- PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema location and imports
- New schema imports from `src/schemas/` directory

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are WF2 components still importing from `api_models.py`?
2. Where should PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest schema be located now?
3. Are schema imports updated in `src/routers/places_staging.py`?

### Step 3: Router Analysis (Layer 3)
**Check this specific file:**
- `src/routers/places_staging.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are import statements updated for new ENUM/schema locations?
2. Does the endpoint `PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status` still work?
3. Is PlaceBatchStatusUpdateRequest validation using the new schema structure?
4. Are PlaceStatusEnum, DeepScanStatusEnum, and PlaceStagingStatusEnum imports updated?

### Step 4: Service Layer Analysis (Layer 4)
**Check these specific WF2 files:**
- `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
- `src/services/places_deep_service.py`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are ENUM imports updated to use `src.models.enums`?
2. Do services still reference the correct Place model and ENUMs?
3. Are DeepScanStatusEnum references working correctly?

### Step 5: Model Integration Analysis (Layer 1)
**Check model relationships:**
- `src/models/place.py` (primary model)
- `src/models/local_business.py` (produced for WF3)
- `src/models/base.py` (inheritance)

**Questions to answer:**
1. Are all models using proper BaseModel inheritance?
2. Are foreign key relationships intact after Guardian changes?
3. Are ENUM field definitions using centralized ENUMs?

### Step 6: Integration Points Analysis
**Check WF2's interfaces:**
- **WF1 ‚Üí WF2:** Consumes from `places_staging` table with `status=PlaceStatusEnum.New`
- **WF2 ‚Üí WF3:** Produces to `local_businesses` table with `status=PlaceStatusEnum.Selected`

**Questions to answer:**
1. Does WF2 still read from `places_staging` with correct ENUM values?
2. Does WF2 still write to `local_businesses` table correctly?
3. Are status handoff mechanisms still functional with centralized ENUMs?
