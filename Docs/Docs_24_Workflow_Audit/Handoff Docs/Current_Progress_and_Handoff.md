- Proper tenant_id handling with UUID type safety
- Transaction boundaries managed by router, business logic in service
- Stale item processing (reset stuck ANALYZING domains to PENDING)
- Auto-queueing: When domains set to SELECTED → triggers sitemap analysis

## Current Status Summary

**✅ COMPLETE Workflows:**

- **Phase 0**: Foundational Remediation
- **WF1**: Google Maps API Places
- **WF2**: Staging Editor
- **WF3**: Local Business Curation
- **WF4**: Domain Curation ← **NEWLY COMPLETED**

**🔄 NEXT: WF5 Implementation**

## Architectural Patterns Established ✅

The project now consistently follows the established architectural blueprint:

### Service Layer Pattern ✅

- **Transaction-Aware Services**: Services work within transactions but don't manage them
- **Business Logic Centralization**: All business logic moved from routers to services
- **Consistent Method Signatures**: Standardized async/await patterns
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper exception management and logging

### Background Scheduler Pattern ✅

- **Status-Driven Processing**: Schedulers poll for status-based work queues
- **Stale Item Management**: Automatic recovery from stuck processing states
- **Configurable Batch Sizes**: Adjustable processing batch sizes per workflow
- **Producer-Consumer Chains**: Clean handoffs between workflow stages

### Router Refactoring Pattern ✅

- **HTTP Concerns Only**: Routers handle only HTTP-specific logic
- **Transaction Boundary Ownership**: Routers manage database transaction boundaries
- **Service Layer Delegation**: All business logic delegated to services
- **Consistent Error Responses**: Standardized HTTP error handling

### ENUM Centralization ✅

- **Single Source of Truth**: All ENUMs in `src/models/enums.py`
- **Cross-Workflow Compatibility**: Standardized status values across workflows
- **Type Safety**: Proper type hints and validation throughout

## Next Steps - WF5

Based on the established pattern, WF5 implementation should follow the same blueprint:

1. **Semantic Search Analysis**: Execute required semantic searches for WF5 context
2. **Service Creation**: Create `WF5Service` with business logic
3. **Scheduler Creation**: Create `WF5Scheduler` for background processing
4. **Router Refactoring**: Refactor WF5 router to use service layer
5. **Schema Enhancement**: Update/create proper schemas for WF5
6. **Integration Testing**: Verify WF4→WF5 handoff connectivity

The foundation is now solid and the pattern is well-established for continuing the remediation work.

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Immediate Next Action**: Execute WF2 (Staging Editor Curation)

**Why WF2 First**: It's the natural next step in the data pipeline flow (WF1 → WF2 → WF3 → WF4 → WF5 → WF6).

**Work Order**: `Docs/Docs_24_Workflow_Audit/Remediation Work Orders/Phase0-Foundational-Remediation.md` (contains WF2 details)

**Key Tasks for WF2**:

1. Create `src/schemas/staging_editor.py`
2. Create `src/services/staging_editor_service.py`
3. Create `src/services/staging_editor_scheduler.py`
4. Update `src/routers/places_staging.py` to use new service/schema
5. Register scheduler in `src/main.py`

### **Systematic Execution Pattern**

Each workflow follows the same pattern:

1. **Schema Migration**: Move Pydantic models from `api_models.py` to `src/schemas/`
2. **Service Creation**: Create dedicated service for business logic
3. **Scheduler Creation**: Create dedicated background task scheduler
4. **Router Simplification**: Update router to use new service/schema
5. **ENUM Centralization**: Ensure all status values use centralized ENUMs
6. **Testing**: Verify producer-consumer handoff works

## 🧠 Knowledge Transfer: Key Insights

### **The Guardian AI Remediation Pattern**

- **Goal**: Enforce architectural blueprints (centralized ENUMs, BaseModel inheritance, schema separation)
- **Challenge**: Implementation was incomplete, breaking workflow handoffs
- **Solution**: Systematic completion of the architectural patterns

### **The Producer-Consumer Chain Issue**

- **Problem**: Workflows use hardcoded strings instead of centralized ENUMs for status triggers
- **Pattern**: `if status == "Selected":` should be `if status == PlaceStatus.QUEUED:`
- **Impact**: Breaks handoffs between workflow stages (WF1→WF2→WF3→WF4→WF5→WF6)

### **The BaseModel Inheritance Pattern**

- **Correct**: `class ModelName(Base, BaseModel):`
- **Incorrect**: `class ModelName(BaseModel):` (missing SQLAlchemy declarative base)
- **Result**: Missing `Base` inheritance = "failed to locate a name" SQLAlchemy errors

### **The Schema Migration Pattern**

- **From**: `src/models/api_models.py` (everything mixed together)
- **To**: `src/schemas/{workflow_name}.py` (separated by workflow)
- **Why**: Separation of concerns, cleaner imports, workflow-specific schemas

## 🆘 Emergency Diagnostic Commands

### **Quick Health Checks**

```bash
# Test SQLAlchemy models are working
python -c "from src.models import Domain, LocalBusiness, Place, Page, SitemapFile; print('✅ Models OK')"

# Test WF1 (Single Search) is working
pytest tests/routers/test_google_maps_api.py::test_search_places_success -vv -s

# Check ENUM centralization
python -c "from src.models.enums import PlaceStatus, SitemapCurationStatus; print('✅ ENUMs OK')"

# Vector search for context
python3 Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/Scripts/semantic_query_cli.py "your search query here"
````

### **Common Error Patterns & Solutions**

```bash
# SQLAlchemy "failed to locate a name" = Missing Base inheritance
grep -r "class.*BaseModel.*:" src/models/
# Should show: class ModelName(Base, BaseModel):

# Hardcoded status strings = Need ENUM centralization
grep -r "== ['\"]Selected['\"]" src/
# Should use: status == PlaceStatus.QUEUED

# Import errors = Check circular dependencies
grep -r "from.*models.*import" src/models/ | grep -v "__init__"
```
