## üéØ System Overview

### What This System Does

The ScraperSky Debug Tools provide **runtime introspection capabilities** for:

- **File Loading Analysis**: Track which Python files are actually loaded during execution
- **Module Dependency Mapping**: Understand real vs. declared dependencies  
- **Orphaned Code Detection**: Identify files that exist but are never loaded
- **Request/Response Logging**: Debug HTTP traffic and API behavior
- **Route Introspection**: Examine all registered FastAPI routes
- **Performance Profiling**: Understand application startup and runtime behavior

### Why This System Was Built

This was created to solve **critical architectural challenges**:

1. **Code Audit Requirements**: Need to understand what code is actually used vs. what exists
2. **Dependency Hell**: Complex import chains made it impossible to understand true dependencies
3. **Performance Investigation**: Startup times and load patterns needed analysis
4. **Refactoring Safety**: Before removing code, need proof it's not used
5. **Documentation Gap**: No way to know what routes/features actually exist at runtime

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components

### Component Structure

```
src/debug_tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py          # Main enable_debug() function & orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime_tracer.py    # Core file/module tracking system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.py        # HTTP request/response debugging
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes.py           # Debug endpoints for introspection
```

### File Responsibilities

#### `src/debug_tools/__init__.py`
- **Primary Function**: `enable_debug(app)` - Single entry point to activate all debug features
- **Orchestration**: Manages startup/shutdown hooks, middleware registration, route inclusion
- **Conditional Loading**: Only imports debug modules when needed

#### `src/debug_tools/runtime_tracer.py`
- **Core Capability**: Python `sys.settrace()` integration for tracking file execution
- **Thread Safety**: Uses locks for concurrent access to tracking data
- **Path Filtering**: Specifically tracks `/app/src/*.py` files (Docker environment aware)
- **Module Mapping**: Converts file paths to module names for dependency analysis

#### `src/debug_tools/middleware.py`
- **HTTP Debugging**: Logs all incoming requests and outgoing responses
- **Performance Timing**: Tracks request processing duration
- **Error Capture**: Catches and logs exceptions during request processing

#### `src/debug_tools/routes.py`
- **Route Introspection**: `/debug/routes` - Lists all registered FastAPI routes
- **File Analysis**: `/debug/loaded-src-files` - Returns all files loaded during runtime
- **Real-time Access**: Available during application execution for live debugging

---

## üîß Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following structure exists:
```
src/debug_tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ runtime_tracer.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ routes.py
```

### Environment Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Enable debug mode (disables production optimizations)
FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

### Application Integration

The debug system is **conditionally loaded** in `src/main.py`:

```python
# In main.py
from pydantic import BaseSettings

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    debug_mode: bool = False  # env FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE

settings = Settings()

# Conditional debug loading
if settings.debug_mode:
    from src.debug_tools import enable_debug
    enable_debug(app)
    logger.info("Debug mode enabled - debug tools loaded")
else:
    logger.info("Debug mode disabled - production mode")
```

---

## üöÄ Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Code Audit & Orphan Detection

**Objective**: Find unused files in the codebase

**Process**:
1. Enable debug mode: `FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true`
2. Start the application: `python run_server.py`
3. Exercise all major workflows (visit pages, trigger APIs, run background jobs)
4. Access `/debug/loaded-src-files` to get the list of loaded files
5. Compare against filesystem to identify orphaned files

**Tools Available**:
```bash
# Compare loaded files vs filesystem
python tools/file_discovery.py  # Lists all Python files
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/loaded-src-files  # Lists loaded files
```

### Scenario 2: Dependency Analysis

**Objective**: Understand true module dependencies

**Process**:
1. Enable debug mode and start application
2. Trigger specific features/workflows
3. Use `/debug/loaded-src-files` to see which modules were actually imported
4. Cross-reference with static analysis to find discrepancies

### Scenario 3: Performance Investigation

**Objective**: Identify slow-loading modules or routes

**Process**:
1. Enable debug mode
2. Monitor startup logs for file loading patterns
3. Use middleware logging to identify slow endpoints
4. Correlate file loading with performance bottlenecks

### Scenario 4: API Discovery & Documentation

**Objective**: Generate complete API inventory

**Process**:
1. Start application with debug enabled
2. Access `/debug/routes` for complete route listing
3. Export data for documentation generation
4. Verify all intended routes are registered

## üîç Debugging Workflows

### Workflow 1: New Feature Impact Analysis

When adding new features, use this to understand impact:

```bash
# 1. Baseline - capture current loaded files
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/loaded-src-files > baseline_files.json

# 2. Add new feature and restart

# 3. Capture new state
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/loaded-src-files > new_files.json

# 4. Compare to see what new files are loaded
diff baseline_files.json new_files.json
```

### Workflow 2: Refactoring Safety Check

Before removing code:

```bash
# 1. Enable debug and exercise full application
FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true python run_server.py

# 2. Run comprehensive test suite
pytest -q

# 3. Exercise all UI workflows manually

# 4. Get final loaded file list
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/loaded-src-files > used_files.json

# 5. Any file not in used_files.json is a candidate for removal
```

### Workflow 3: Import Optimization

To optimize startup time:

```bash
# 1. Enable debug mode with timing
FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true python run_server.py

# 2. Analyze startup logs for slow imports
grep "Starting runtime file tracing" logs/app.log -A 100

# 3. Use /debug/loaded-src-files to see load order
# Files loaded later in the list may be good candidates for lazy loading
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode Not Working

**Symptoms**: Debug routes return 404, no tracing logs

**Solutions**:
1. Verify environment variable: `echo $FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE`
2. Check main.py has conditional loading logic
3. Verify debug_tools package structure
4. Check for import errors in debug modules

### File Tracking Missing Files

**Symptoms**: Known-loaded files don't appear in `/debug/loaded-src-files`

**Possible Causes**:
1. Path filtering issue - runtime_tracer only tracks `/app/src/*.py`
2. Files loaded before tracing starts
3. C extensions or bytecode files

**Solutions**:
```python
# In runtime_tracer.py, temporarily broaden path filter:
if abs_filename.endswith(".py"):  # Remove /app/src/ filter temporarily
```

### Performance Impact

**Symptoms**: Application runs slowly with debug enabled

**Expected Behavior**: This is normal - `sys.settrace()` adds overhead

**Mitigation**:
- Only enable for debugging sessions
- Disable reload in run_server.py when debug is active

### Debug Routes Conflict

**Symptoms**: `/debug/routes` conflicts with application routes

**Solution**: Debug routes are prefixed with `/debug/` to avoid conflicts

---

## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Custom Path Filtering

Modify `runtime_tracer.py` to track different paths:

```python
# Current: Only /app/src/*.py
if abs_filename.startswith("/app/src/") and abs_filename.endswith(".py"):

# Example: Track all Python files
if abs_filename.endswith(".py"):

# Example: Track specific modules only  
if "models" in abs_filename and abs_filename.endswith(".py"):
```

### Enhanced Logging

Add more detailed logging in `middleware.py`:

```python
async def debug_request_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    start_time = time.time()
    logger.debug(f"Request: {request.method} {request.url.path}")
    
    response = await call_next(request)
    
    process_time = time.time() - start_time
    logger.debug(f"Response: {response.status_code} in {process_time:.3f}s")
    return response
```

### Export Capabilities

Add data export to `routes.py`:

```python
@router.get("/export-analysis")
async def export_analysis():
    """Export complete debugging analysis"""
    return {
        "loaded_files": sorted(list(get_loaded_files())),
        "loaded_modules": sorted(list(get_loaded_modules())),
        "routes": [route.__dict__ for route in app.routes],
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
```

## üìù Migration Notes

### From Legacy ENABLE_IMPORT_TRACING

**Old System**:
```bash
ENABLE_IMPORT_TRACING=true python run_server.py
```

**New System**:
```bash
FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true python run_server.py
```

**Changes Made**:
1. Environment variable renamed for clarity
2. Debug code moved from main.py to dedicated package
3. Conditional loading implemented
4. Middleware and routes separated into modules

### Preserving Historical Debug Data

If you have previous debug logs or runtime analysis:

1. **Log Format**: New system maintains same log patterns
2. **File Paths**: Still tracks `/app/src/*.py` pattern
3. **Route Format**: Same JSON structure for routes endpoint
4. **API Compatibility**: `/debug/` endpoints maintain same responses

## üÜò Emergency Restoration Procedures

### If Debug System is Broken

**Step 1**: Verify file structure
```bash
find src/debug_tools -type f -name "*.py" | sort
# Should show:
# src/debug_tools/__init__.py
# src/debug_tools/middleware.py  
# src/debug_tools/routes.py
# src/debug_tools/runtime_tracer.py
```

**Step 2**: Check main.py integration
```bash
grep -A 5 -B 5 "debug_mode" src/main.py
# Should show conditional loading block
```

**Step 3**: Verify environment setup
```bash
grep FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE .env
# Should show: FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

**Step 4**: Test debug endpoints
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/routes
curl http://localhost:8000/debug/loaded-src-files
```

### Complete System Restoration

If the entire debug system needs restoration, use this git command to find the implementation:

```bash
# Find the commit where debug tools were created
git log --oneline --grep="debug.*tools\|debug.*cleanup"

# Restore from this document's specifications
# All code is documented in the Architecture section above
```

---

## üìä Expected Outcomes & Metrics

### File Reduction Metrics

After using this system for cleanup:
- **main.py**: Reduced from ~975 lines to ~410 lines (58% reduction)
- **Debug overhead**: Moved 400+ lines to dedicated package
- **Startup time**: Improved in production (no debug overhead)

### Debugging Capabilities Gained

1. **Real-time file tracking**: Know exactly which files are loaded
2. **API inventory**: Complete route listing with methods
3. **Request debugging**: HTTP-level logging and analysis
4. **Dependency mapping**: Understand true vs. declared dependencies
5. **Performance analysis**: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT WARNINGS

### Production Usage

**NEVER** enable debug mode in production:
- Significant performance overhead from `sys.settrace()`
- Exposes internal application structure via debug routes
- Logs may contain sensitive information

### Security Considerations

Debug endpoints expose:
- Internal file structure
- Route definitions and methods
- Application architecture details

**Always** ensure `FASTAPI_DEBUG_MODE=false` in production environments.

### Performance Impact

With debug enabled:
- 20-30% performance overhead expected
- Increased memory usage for tracking data
- Slower startup times due to tracing initialization

This is **intentional** and **acceptable** for debugging sessions.
