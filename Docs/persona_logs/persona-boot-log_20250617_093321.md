doc_summaries:
  v_db_connectivity_mcp_4_manual_ops: "This guide details using `mcp4_execute_sql` (project ID `ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz`) for manual Supabase vector DB queries. It provides SQL patterns for listing, getting, and searching documents, including client-side embedding generation for semantic search. It also covers troubleshooting, critical `asyncpg` settings (`statement_cache_size=0`), and table schemas."
  v_db_connectivity_async_4_vector_ops: "This document outlines `asyncpg` Python library usage for programmatic ScraperSky vector DB access. It mandates `DATABASE_URL` setup (converting from SQLAlchemy format, removing query params), `statement_cache_size=0`, omitting `ssl='require'` for Supabase/pgbouncer, and ensuring the `vector` extension. It differentiates `asyncpg` use cases (scripts like `insert_architectural_docs.py`) from MCP."
  v_complete_reference: "A comprehensive guide for ScraperSky's Vector DB, referencing key documents (deferring to `v_key_documents.md` for the curated list), AI personas, connectivity (`mcp4_execute_sql` with project ID `ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz`, `asyncpg`), Document Registry management scripts (e.g., `1-registry-directory-manager.py`, `2-registry-document-scanner.py`), and test questions for system understanding."
pattern_verification: "Following initialization sequence in knowledge_librarian_persona_v2.md, Section 2."
duplicate_check: "None found; this is the initial boot log."
