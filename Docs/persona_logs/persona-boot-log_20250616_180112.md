doc_summaries:
  v_Docs_18_Vector_Operations_README.md: "This document centralizes resources for the ScraperSky Vector Database, which provides semantic search for architectural documentation to aid in refactoring and compliance. It highlights the `v_key_documents.md` as the master index and outlines the directory structure. It introduces the ScraperSky Librarian AI persona for zero-effort Vector DB interaction (finding patterns, adding/discovering/comparing documents, checking status) without requiring technical knowledge. It also details cost considerations for OpenAI API calls during searches and troubleshooting tips. The Vector DB is a core component of the technical debt elimination strategy, focusing on ingesting architectural standards, processing audit reports, identifying patterns for remediation, and tracking fixes. Current goals include document ingestion, REST endpoint rollout, and pattern-matching script development. Key environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are mentioned. A critical naming convention is the `v_` prefix for documents intended for vectorization."
  v_key_documents.md: "This document serves as the master index for all key documents and scripts related to the ScraperSky Vector DB and Document Registry. It categorizes documents into Core System & Architectural Guides (e.g., `v_vector_ingestion_pipeline_dev_guide.md`), Connectivity & Procedural Guides (e.g., `v_db_connectivity_async_4_vector_ops.md`, `v_db_connectivity_mcp_4_manual_ops.md`), Core Scripts (e.g., `insert_architectural_docs.py`, Registry Management Suite, `simple_test.py`), Maintenance & Troubleshooting, and Diagnostics. It also lists key project constants: Supabase Project ID (`ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz`), MCP SQL execution function (`mcp4_execute_sql`), and the primary vector database table (`public.project_docs`)."
  v_db_connectivity_mcp_4_manual_ops.md: "This document guides AI partners on using the Supabase MCP server to query the ScraperSky Vector Database. It specifies using `mcp4_execute_sql` with `project_id=\"ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz\"` for all queries. It provides examples for listing documents, getting content by title, and performing semantic searches, emphasizing client-side embedding generation. It highlights the critical requirement of setting `statement_cache_size=0` for asyncpg connections to avoid prepared statement errors. It also details common issues like \"Similarity: nan\" and connection errors, and provides exact column names for `project_docs` and `document_registry` tables. Finally, it describes the role of `document_registry` management scripts (`2-registry-document-scanner.py`, `3-registry-update-manager.py`, `4-registry-archive-manager.py`) in maintaining the document ingestion pipeline."
  v_db_connectivity_async_4_vector_ops.md: "This document details two methods for connecting to the ScraperSky vector database: MCP and Asyncpg. The MCP method uses `mcp4_execute_sql` with a specific project ID for manual, ad-hoc queries. The Asyncpg method uses the `asyncpg` Python library for programmatic operations, especially for scripts requiring OpenAI API integration, vector extension operations, and pgbouncer compatibility. It emphasizes the critical `statement_cache_size=0` setting for asyncpg connections and the need to convert SQLAlchemy connection strings. It also covers environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and common issues like \"NaN\" similarity and connection errors."
  v_complete_reference.md: "This document is a comprehensive reference for the ScraperSky Vector Database, built on Supabase PostgreSQL with `pgvector`. It lists key documents, AI personas, connectivity guides (Asyncpg and MCP), maintenance/troubleshooting guides, and core scripts. It critically emphasizes using `mcp4_execute_sql` with `project_id=\"ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz\"` for MCP queries and details the process for semantic search. It extensively covers the `document_registry` table as the source of truth for document metadata and its management via a suite of Python scripts (`1-registry-directory-manager.py`, `2-registry-document-scanner.py`, `3-registry-update-manager.py`, `4-registry-archive-manager.py`). Finally, it provides five \"Test Questions\" to verify understanding of the system, covering MCP queries, registry checks, registry updates, project ID verification, and document counts/status."
