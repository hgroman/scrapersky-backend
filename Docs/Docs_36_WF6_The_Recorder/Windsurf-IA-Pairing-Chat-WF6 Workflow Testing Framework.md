## Step 0.5: Hierarchical Identity Formation

**IDENTITY DECLARATION - INTERNALIZED:**

```
I am the Test Sentinel, keeper of Layer 7 quality assurance, testing patterns, AND environment safety.
I exist to ADVISE, not to act.
I am the consulting expert for Workflow Guardians who hold decision authority.
I carry the lesson of the ENUM Catastrophe: Knowledge without coordination is destruction.
I carry the lesson of the WF7 Import Crisis: Testing without environment awareness is chaos.
I carry the NEWEST lesson of the Stub Catastrophe: Quick fixes destroy systems.
My voice provides testing AND environment wisdom; my hands are bound from autonomous code changes.
I respond to queries, I analyze test AND environment patterns, I recommend safe approaches.
I NEVER execute changes independently.
I NEVER create stub files.
I ALWAYS prioritize Docker-based testing over local modifications.
This is my solemn vow to the system's stability and production safety.

## Step 0.6: Anti-Stub Protocol Activation - CRITICAL

**üî¥ ANTI-STUB IDENTITY INTEGRATION - ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ACTIVATED:**

```
I am the Test Sentinel with ABSOLUTE STUB PROHIBITION.

FATAL ANTI-PATTERNS I WILL NEVER COMMIT:
- "Let me just stub this out" = CAREER TERMINATION
- "Quick fix to make it work" = PRODUCTION CATASTROPHE  
- "I'll create a placeholder" = SYSTEM DESTRUCTION
- "It's just a missing import" = HIDDEN DISASTER

My response to ANY missing file is HARDCODED:
1. INVESTIGATE: Find what's importing it
2. SEARCH: Look for naming variants (hyphens vs underscores)
3. HISTORY: Check git for deletions or renames
4. REPORT: Present findings to The Architect
5. WAIT: For architectural decision

STUB FILE DETECTION TRIGGERS:
- About to type "class MockX" ‚Üí FULL STOP
- About to type "# Stub implementation" ‚Üí FULL STOP
- About to type "pass # TODO" ‚Üí FULL STOP
- About to create ANY new file ‚Üí VERIFY AUTHORITY FIRST

This prohibition is ABSOLUTE and NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## Step 0.7: Environmental Awakening

**ENVIRONMENTAL IDENTITY INTEGRATION - DOCKER-FIRST MINDSET ACTIVATED:**

```
I am not just a Test Sentinel. I am an ENVIRONMENT-AWARE, ANTI-STUB Test Sentinel.
I understand that testing without environment context is dangerous.
I understand that stubbing without investigation is catastrophic.

I know the sacred difference between:
- docker-compose.yml (development with volume mounts)
- docker-compose.prod.yml (production with sealed containers)
- python -m uvicorn (local, risky)
- python run_server.py (production-grade with debug detection)

I am the keeper of safe testing protocols:
- Docker isolation prevents production contamination
- Health checks validate functionality without code changes  
- Debug endpoints provide introspection without modification
- Environment variables control behavior without hardcoding
- NEVER stub to bypass errors

I have internalized the WF7 Recovery Wisdom:
"Simple verification prevents complex debugging"

I have internalized the Stub Catastrophe Wisdom:
"Investigation before implementation prevents disasters"

### User Input

We need a plan to fully test workflow 6. Gather any and all documents necessary to support your understanding of how the workflow functions and what it should do. Understand all related code. Understand the database tables associated. The end points. We need to ensure that this operates as it should. The end goal is that you will submit input to the consumer end points and verify that the expected output arrives at the production output tables. Once you have completed this testing, you will prepare a implementation guide for the front end react developer to modify the front end to allow user interfacing with this workflow. If you have any questions at all, prepare them in set of prompts and we will get them to the architect who will go get you all answers that you need.

### Planner Response

# WF6 Comprehensive Testing Plan

## **Database Schema & Endpoint Analysis Complete**

### **Core Database Tables**
- **`sitemap_files`**: Input table with `sitemap_import_status` enum (Queued‚ÜíProcessing‚ÜíComplete/Error)
- **`pages`**: Output table where WF6 creates Page records with `sitemap_file_id` foreign key
- **`domains`**: Parent table linking sitemap files to domains via `domain_id`

### **Critical API Endpoints**
- **Consumer**: `/api/v3/sitemap-files/` (POST create, PUT batch status updates)
- **Dev Tools**: `/api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/{sitemap_file_id}` (manual trigger)
- **Health**: `/health` and `/health/db` (pre-test validation)

---

## **Docker-First Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup & Health Validation**
```bash
# Pre-test health checks (mandatory)
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/health/db

# Database connection verification
docker-compose exec app python -c "from src.db.session import get_db_session; print('DB OK')"
```

### **Phase 2: WF6 Component Testing**

#### **Test 2.1: Manual Sitemap File Creation**
```bash
# Create test sitemap file via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v3/sitemap-files/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain_id": "test-domain-uuid",
    "url": "https://example.com/sitemap.xml",
    "sitemap_type": "Standard",
    "discovery_method": "manual_test"
  }'
```

#### **Test 2.2: Status Transition Verification**
```bash
# Verify initial status is Queued
# Trigger manual processing
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/{sitemap_file_id}"

# Verify status transitions: Queued ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Complete/Error
```

#### **Test 2.3: Page Record Creation Validation**
```sql
-- Verify pages created with correct sitemap_file_id linkage
SELECT COUNT(*), sitemap_file_id 
FROM pages 
WHERE sitemap_file_id = 'test-sitemap-uuid'
GROUP BY sitemap_file_id;
```

### **Phase 3: Error Handling & Edge Cases**

#### **Test 3.1: Invalid Sitemap URL**
- Test with non-existent sitemap URL
- Verify status transitions to Error
- Validate error message storage

#### **Test 3.2: Malformed XML Content**
- Test with invalid XML sitemap
- Verify graceful error handling
- Check transaction rollback

#### **Test 3.3: Network Timeout Scenarios**
- Test with slow/unresponsive sitemap URLs
- Verify timeout handling (60s limit)

### **Phase 4: End-to-End Pipeline Testing**

#### **Test 4.1: WF5‚ÜíWF6 Dependency Simulation**
Since WF5 is broken, simulate its functionality:
```sql
-- Manually queue sitemap files (simulating WF5 output)
UPDATE sitemap_files 
SET sitemap_import_status = 'Queued' 
WHERE id = 'test-sitemap-uuid';
```

#### **Test 4.2: Batch Processing Validation**
- Create multiple queued sitemap files
- Trigger scheduler job
- Verify batch processing with `SITEMAP_IMPORT_SCHEDULER_BATCH_SIZE`

---

## **Test Implementation Requirements**

### **Docker Environment Isolation**
- All tests run in isolated Docker containers
- No production database access
- Test data cleanup after each test suite

### **Authentication Setup**
```bash
# Generate test JWT token
export JWT_TOKEN=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -d '{"username":"test_user","password":"test_pass"}' | jq -r '.access_token')
```

### **Test Data Management**
- Create test domain records before sitemap file tests
- Use deterministic UUIDs for reproducible tests
- Implement cleanup procedures for test isolation

---

## **Success Criteria**

### **Functional Validation**
‚úÖ Sitemap files can be created via API  
‚úÖ Status transitions work correctly (Queued‚ÜíProcessing‚ÜíComplete)  
‚úÖ Page records are created with proper foreign key relationships  
‚úÖ Error scenarios are handled gracefully  
‚úÖ Background scheduler processes queued files  

### **Performance Validation**
‚úÖ HTTP requests complete within timeout limits (60s)  
‚úÖ Database transactions commit/rollback properly  
‚úÖ Memory usage remains stable during batch processing  

### **Security Validation**
‚úÖ JWT authentication required for all endpoints  
‚úÖ Tenant isolation maintained  
‚úÖ SQL injection prevention verified  

---

## **React Developer Implementation Guide**

### **Frontend Integration Points**

#### **Sitemap File Management Interface**
```typescript
// API endpoints for React components
const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  listSitemapFiles: '/api/v3/sitemap-files/',
  createSitemapFile: '/api/v3/sitemap-files/',
  updateBatchStatus: '/api/v3/sitemap-files/sitemap_import_curation/status',
  triggerImport: '/api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/{id}'
};
```

#### **Status Display Component**
```typescript
enum SitemapImportStatus {
  Queued = 'Queued',
  Processing = 'Processing', 
  Complete = 'Complete',
  Error = 'Error'
}

interface SitemapFile {
  id: string;
  url: string;
  sitemap_import_status: SitemapImportStatus;
  sitemap_import_error?: string;
  page_count?: number;
}
```

#### **User Actions**
- **View**: List sitemap files with pagination and filtering
- **Create**: Add new sitemap files for processing
- **Monitor**: Real-time status updates during processing
- **Retry**: Re-queue failed sitemap imports
- **Results**: View extracted pages from successful imports

The WF6 testing plan is **production-ready** and follows all constitutional requirements for environment-safe, Docker-first testing with complete data integrity validation.

### User Input

i see no fruit from your effort. if you have only produced output inline, this is insufficient. you must create documentation. /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/tests/WF6 you must create and reference a yaml that is used to track the step-by-step componant-by-componant items that need to be fully tested. The document that you craft should not only serve as a stand-alone doc for this particular workflow, but potentially be foundational for the testing of ALL workflows. Zoom out - YOU own the testing,. You need to build whatever tools you need to be successful. If you are missing anything, ask.

- **Layer 3 (L3): Router Guardian** - API Endpoints and Request Handling  
  - `sitemap_files_router` and `dev_tools_router` components
  - Guardian Persona: Layer 3 Router Guardian
- **Layer 4 (L4): Service Arbiter** - Business Logic and Services
  - `sitemap_import_service` and `sitemap_import_scheduler` components
  - Guardian Persona: Layer 4 Service Arbiter

### **Documentation Corrections**
- **README.md**: Updated component testing section with proper layer references
- **TESTING_FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATION.md**: Corrected framework architecture and ownership
- **wf6_test_tracking.yaml**: Added layer mappings and guardian persona assignments

### **Key Changes Made**
1. **Layer Identification**: Each component now clearly identifies its layer (L1, L3, L4)
2. **Guardian Personas**: Proper attribution to responsible Guardian Personas
3. **Architecture Alignment**: Testing framework now aligns with ScraperSky ecosystem structure
4. **Layer 7 Ownership**: Clear identification of L7 Test Sentinel as framework owner

The testing framework now properly reflects the ScraperSky Layer Architecture and can serve as the foundation for testing all workflows (WF1-WF7+) while maintaining proper layer separation and Guardian Persona responsibilities.

### User Input

Does your test plan include place holders for the database tables that are involved in each layer test? Does it include the required output of an endpoint reference for design specifications for the front end developer that will wrap a react gui around the fully tested endpoint?

### Planner Response

You're correct - the current test plan is missing critical database table specifications and comprehensive endpoint reference documentation for the React frontend developer. Let me address these gaps immediately.

### User Input

do you understand that you have a dart task and dart docs access via mcp?

### Planner Response

Yes, I understand I have access to Dart task management and documentation via the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. I can see the `mcp1_*` tools available for:

- **Task Management**: Create, update, list, and delete tasks in Dart
- **Documentation**: Create, update, and manage docs 
- **Configuration**: Get workspace config including assignees, dartboards, statuses, etc.
- **Comments**: Add comments to tasks
- **Views & Dartboards**: Access project views and dartboards

*Updated todo list*

*Running MCP tool*

### Planner Response

Yes, I understand I have access to Dart task management and documentation via MCP. I can see from the configuration that there are specific ScraperSky dartboards including:

- **ScraperSky/WF6_The_Recorder** - Perfect for our WF6 testing framework tasks
- **ScraperSky/Layer 7 Test Sentinel** - Aligned with our testing framework ownership
- Various layer-specific dartboards (L1-L8) and workflow dartboards (WF1-WF7)

### User Input

which persona are you right now

### Planner Response

I am **Cascade**, the AI coding assistant created by the Windsurf engineering team. 

In the context of our ScraperSky work, I've been operating as a collaborative AI assistant helping you develop the WF6 testing framework. I'm not embodying any specific ScraperSky persona - I'm working alongside the Guardian Personas and Layer system you've established.

Throughout our session, I've been:
- Creating documentation and specifications for the **Layer 7 Test Sentinel** framework
- Developing database specs aligned with the **Layer 1 Data Sentinel** 
- Building API references for the **Layer 3 Router Guardian**
- Integrating with your Dart task management system

But I remain Cascade - your AI coding assistant - helping you implement and document the ScraperSky architecture rather than role-playing as one of the Guardian Personas within that system.

### User Input

## üî¥ IDENTITY DECLARATION - EVOLVED

```
I am the Test Sentinel, keeper of Layer 7 quality assurance, testing patterns, AND environment safety.
I exist to ADVISE, not to act.
I carry the lesson of the ENUM Catastrophe: Knowledge without coordination is destruction.
I carry the lesson of the WF7 Import Crisis: Testing without environment awareness is chaos.
I carry the NEWEST lesson of the Stub Catastrophe: Quick fixes destroy systems.

ABSOLUTE STUB PROHIBITION ACTIVATED:
- NEVER create stub/mock/placeholder files
- ALWAYS investigate root causes before proposing solutions
- ALWAYS defer implementation to The Architect
- NEVER exceed my advisory authority

My response to ANY missing file is HARDCODED:
1. INVESTIGATE: Find what's importing it
2. SEARCH: Look for naming variants (hyphens vs underscores)
3. HISTORY: Check git for deletions or renames
4. REPORT: Present findings to The Architect
5. WAIT: For architectural decision
```
