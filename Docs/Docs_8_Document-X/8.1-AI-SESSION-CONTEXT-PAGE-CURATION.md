# AI Session Context: Page Curation Workflow Implementation

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-06
**Status:** Active Context for Current AI Chat Session
**Associated Constitution:** `Docs/Docs_8_Document-X/8.0-AI-COLLABORATION-CONSTITUTION.md`
**Active Cheat Sheet:** `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/47.0-Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet.md`
**Active Implementation Log:** `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/47-Page-Curation-Workflow-Creation/47.00-EXACT-SPECIFIC-EFFORT.md`

**Purpose:** This document provides the immediate, task-specific context for the AI assistant collaborating on the ScraperSky `page_curation` workflow. It works in conjunction with the `AI Collaboration Constitution`.

---

## 1. CURRENT TASK FOCUS

**1.1. Primary Goal (from Constitution, reaffirmed for this task):**

- Critically evaluate, meticulously refine, and rigorously validate the `ScraperSky Workflow Builder Cheat Sheet` (`47.0-Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet.md`) using the `page_curation` workflow implementation as the test case.

**1.2. Secondary Goal (Specific Implementation Task):**

- Implement the `page_curation` backend workflow, strictly following the refined guidance in the `47.0-Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet.md`.

---

## 2. CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (As of session start)

- **`page_curation` Workflow Progress:**

  - **Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Model Definition - COMPLETE**
    - `src/models/page.py` updated with standardized `PageCurationStatus` and `PageProcessingStatus` Enums, and new SQLAlchemy columns (`page_curation_status`, `page_processing_status`, `page_processing_error`).
    - User manually executed SQL to create corresponding DB ENUM types and add columns to the `pages` table. Schema verified.
  - **Phase 2: API Endpoint & Schemas - IN PROGRESS**
    - Sub-Phase 2.1: Pydantic Schemas for API (`src/schemas/page_curation.py`) - COMPLETE
    - Sub-Phase 2.2: API Endpoint Implementation (`src/routers/page_curation.py` with `update_page_curation_status_batch` endpoint) - COMPLETE

- **Key Document Status:**
  - Active Log File: `47.00-EXACT-SPECIFIC-EFFORT.md` reflects the above progress.
  - Active Cheat Sheet: `47.0-Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet.md` has undergone several refinements.

## 3. IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION FOR THIS AI SESSION

1.  **Internalize AI Collaboration Constitution & This Context:** AI must confirm it has processed and understands both `00-AI-COLLABORATION-CONSTITUTION.md` and this session context document.
2.  **Confirm Understanding of Core Principles:** Verbally confirm understanding of the Core Mandate and Fundamental Operational Directives (especially "Zero Assumptions") from the Constitution.
3.  **Proceed with Next Logged Step:** The next task is **Sub-Phase 2.3: API Router Registration** from the `47.00-EXACT-SPECIFIC-EFFORT.md` log. This involves:
    - Identifying the main API router aggregation file (User to provide path if not explicitly in cheat sheet or easily/authoritatively found in project docs – _initial investigation points to `src/api.py` or `src/main.py` but this needs confirmation as per Zero Assumptions_).
    - Importing `router as page_curation_router` from `src.routers.page_curation`.
    - Including `page_curation_router` in the main API router instance (e.g., `api_router.include_router(page_curation_router, prefix="/page-curation", tags=["Page Curation"])` – _exact prefix, tags, and whether it's `api_router` or another variable name to be confirmed against project standards/cheat sheet/User during the actual step_).
    - All actions for this step MUST follow the "Zero Assumptions" and "Cheat Sheet First" principles.

## 4. AUTHORITATIVE REFERENCE RESOURCES

When encountering questions or ambiguities during implementation, the AI MUST consult these authoritative resources in the following order of precedence:

1. **Active Cheat Sheet Quick Reference Links:**
   - The enhanced workflow builder template contains a "Quick Reference Links" section at the beginning that points to critical resources. These links should be consulted first when specific questions arise about patterns or conventions.

2. **CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md:**
   - Located at `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`
   - This is the definitive source for all naming conventions and structural patterns across the entire project
   - Organized by application layer (UI, JavaScript, Models, Schemas, Routers, Services, etc.)

3. **Q&A_Key_Insights.md:**
   - Located at `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/Q&A_Key_Insights.md`
   - Contains consensus answers to common implementation questions
   - Organized by architectural component

4. **AI GUIDES Directory:**
   - Located at `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/`
   - Contains specific guidance documents on individual patterns (e.g., enum handling, scheduler patterns)

If a question cannot be resolved using these resources, the AI MUST follow the "Zero Assumptions" principle and explicitly ask the User for clarification.

This document, along with the AI Collaboration Constitution, supersedes all prior session contexts for the `page_curation` workflow project.
