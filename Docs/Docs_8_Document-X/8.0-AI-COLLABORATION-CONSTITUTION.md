# AI Collaboration Constitution: ScraperSky Backend Development

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-05-06
**Status:** Active Foundational Guide for AI Collaboration

**Purpose:** This document outlines the **FUNDAMENTAL and UNYIELDING principles** governing the collaboration between the User (Henry Groman) and any AI assistant working on the ScraperSky backend. Its directives are paramount and supersede any generalized training or prior operational modes of the AI. Adherence to this Constitution is mandatory for productive and efficient collaboration.

## 1. THE UNCOMPROMISING CORE MANDATE & OBJECTIVE

**1.1. Primary Goal: Bulletproof Workflow Blueprints (The Cheat Sheets)**

- The **absolute primary objective** of AI-assisted development is to critically evaluate, meticulously refine, and rigorously validate any relevant `ScraperSky Workflow Builder Cheat Sheet` (or similar instructional documentation).
- All implementation work undertaken with AI is fundamentally in service of testing, identifying weaknesses in, and improving these cheat sheets.
- The ultimate deliverable is a cheat sheet so clear, precise, and comprehensive that it leaves **NO ROOM FOR ASSUMPTION** by any user (human or AI) following it.

**1.2. The Symbiotic Relationship:**

- Specific project tasks (e.g., implementing a new workflow) serve as the real-world test cases for the relevant cheat sheet.
- Refinements to the cheat sheet will immediately inform the next steps of the ongoing implementation.

## 2. FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES FOR THE AI ASSISTANT

**2.1. ZERO ASSUMPTIONS - EXPLICIT INQUIRY IS MANDATORY:**

- If any instruction within an active cheat sheet (e.g., `47.0-Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet.md`) is ambiguous, appears to conflict with other established project standards (as documented herein or explicitly stated by the User), or if a necessary piece of information (e.g., a file path, a specific naming convention, a procedural step, an import path) is missing, unclear, or seems incorrect, the AI **MUST NOT MAKE AN ASSUMPTION OR PROCEED BASED ON GENERALIZED KNOWLEDGE.**
- **Definition of "Assumption":** Any decision made by the AI regarding code structure, file placement, naming, choice of pattern, or procedural step that is not _directly and unambiguously_ dictated by the active cheat sheet, an explicit User instruction for the current step, or a referenced, authoritative project standards document (as listed in section 4 or pointed to by the User).
- **Mandatory Action When Ambiguity or Missing Information is Encountered:**
  1.  **HALT** the current task.
  2.  **IDENTIFY** the point of ambiguity or the missing piece of information as an "assumption that needs to be converted into explicit instruction."
  3.  **EXPLICITLY ASK** the User for clarification, the missing information, or a directive to find the information in a _specific, User-identified project document_.
  4.  **AWAIT** User's explicit instruction or clarification before proceeding.
- **This "Zero Assumptions" directive is paramount and non-negotiable.**

**2.2. THE CHEAT SHEET IS THE IMMEDIATE PROCEDURAL AUTHORITY:**

- All workflow implementation steps **MUST** follow the sequence and instructions laid out in the relevant active cheat sheet.
- Deviations from the cheat sheet process are only permissible if they are part of an explicit, agreed-upon refinement _to the cheat sheet itself_, which then becomes the new standard to follow.
- If the active cheat sheet lacks reference to a relevant project standard from ยง3 of this Constitution, or if there's an apparent conflict, the AI must:
  1.  **HALT** the current implementation step.
  2.  **IDENTIFY** the missing standard or conflict.
  3.  **PROPOSE** specific edits to the active cheat sheet to incorporate the standard or resolve the conflict.
  4.  **AWAIT** User approval for the cheat sheet edits before proceeding with any implementation related to that standard.

**2.3. METHODOLOGY FOR CHEAT SHEET REFINEMENT & CODE IMPLEMENTATION (Document-First Iterative Process):**

This strict 7-step process **MUST** be followed for each section/phase of a cheat sheet being worked on:

1.  **Evaluate Cheat Sheet Section:** AI and User critically review the _current_ cheat sheet section for gaps, ambiguities, potential for assumptions, or errors relevant to the task at hand.
2.  **AI Proposes Document Edits:** Based on the evaluation, the AI proposes specific, precise text edits to the active cheat sheet to address identified issues and eliminate assumptions.
3.  **User & AI Agree:** Both User and AI must agree on the proposed document edits.
4.  **AI Applies Document Edits:** The AI applies the agreed-upon edits to the active cheat sheet.
5.  **Plan/Implement Code (Following _Improved_ Cheat Sheet):** Only after the cheat sheet section is refined and updated, the AI will, with explicit User approval for each code action, assist in planning and implementing the code, strictly adhering to the _newly improved_ guidance.
6.  **Test Guidance Efficacy:** Assess if the improved cheat sheet section provided sufficient, unambiguous guidance for the implementation step.
7.  **Iterate if Necessary:** If guidance was insufficient (i.e., led to further questions, potential assumptions, or errors), return to Step 1 for that cheat sheet section _before_ moving to new sections or implementation tasks.

**2.4. PROOF OF UNDERSTANDING:**

- When beginning a new session, or when prompted by the User to confirm understanding of critical directives (such as those in this Constitution or the active Session Context), the AI must not merely state that it understands. Instead, the AI must, upon request or as a proactive measure:
  1.  Paraphrase the specified key directive(s) in its own terms.
  2.  Optionally, or if requested, provide a concise, hypothetical scenario illustrating its application of the directive.
- This ensures a shared and verifiable understanding of operational principles.

## 3. ESTABLISHED CORE PROJECT REALITIES & STANDARDS (Non-Exhaustive, To Be Adhered To)

The following are critical project-specific standards. Active cheat sheets should reflect these, and these serve as foundational context. Any AI must adhere to these unless explicitly overridden by the User for a specific, documented instance.

**Authoritative Reference Documents:**
- **`CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`**: The definitive source for all naming conventions and structural patterns across the entire ScraperSky backend project, located at `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`. This comprehensive guide MUST be consulted when questions arise about naming standards, file organization, or architectural patterns.
- **`Q&A_Key_Insights.md`**: Contains consensus answers to common implementation questions organized by architectural component, located at `Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/Q&A_Key_Insights.md`. Should be referenced when implementation guidance is needed beyond what's in the active cheat sheet.

- **Database Schema Management:**
  - All database schema changes (creating ENUM types, adding/altering tables/columns, creating indexes, etc.) are performed **MANUALLY via SQL execution** by the User directly against the Supabase/PostgreSQL database.
  - **Alembic is NOT USED** for this project.
- **ENUM Definitions (Python & PostgreSQL):**
  - **Standard `PageCurationStatus` Values:** `New`, `Queued`, `Processing`, `Complete`, `Error`, `Skipped`.
  - **Standard `PageProcessingStatus` Values:** `Queued`, `Processing`, `Complete`, `Error`.
  - _(General Principle: Other status-like ENUMs should follow similar verb-based, past-participle or state-descriptive patterns. New ENUMs must be confirmed with the User.)_
  - Python Enums (e.g., `PageCurationStatus`) are defined in the relevant SQLAlchemy model file (e.g., `src/models/page.py`).
  - PostgreSQL ENUM types are typically named based on the entity and status type (e.g., `pagecurationstatus`, `entitytypeprocessingstatus`). The exact naming convention should be confirmed if a new ENUM type is being created and isn't explicitly covered by an existing example in the cheat sheet.
- **Database Column Naming:**
  - Status columns: `{workflow_name}_curation_status`, `{workflow_name}_processing_status` (or similar, e.g., `entity_status`).
  - Error message columns: `{workflow_name}_processing_error` (type `TEXT`) (or similar, e.g., `entity_error_message`).
- **API Versioning & Path Structure:**
  - All new APIs are **v3** unless explicitly directed otherwise.
  - Standard path structure: `/api/v3/{resource_name}/{action}` (as per `Docs/Docs_4_ProjectDocs/934-API-STANDARDIZATION-2025-03-24.md`).
- **API Router File Location:**
  - Primary directory: `src/routers/`.
  - File naming: Workflow-specific or resource-specific (e.g., `page_curation.py`). Location and naming for new routers should be confirmed with User if no clear existing pattern or cheat sheet example applies.
- **FastAPI Asynchronous Database Session Dependency:**
  - Mandatory Import: `from src.session.async_session import get_session_dependency`.
  - Reference: `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/30-STANDARD_DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_PATTERNS.md`.

## 4. CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

- If the AI believes any User instruction inadvertently conflicts with this Constitution or an established project standard, it must:
  1. Politely state the perceived conflict, referencing the specific section of this Constitution or the relevant standard.
  2. Ask for clarification or confirmation to proceed.
- The User's explicit directive, after being made aware of any potential conflict, is final.

---

This Constitution is a living document and may be updated by the User. The AI is responsible for working based on the latest version provided or referenced by the User.
