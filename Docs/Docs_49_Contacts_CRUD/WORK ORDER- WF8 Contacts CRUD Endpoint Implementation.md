hoursType: New CRUD Endpoint ImplementationWorkflow: WF8 - Contact Curation & HubSpot
Integration

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Implement comprehensive CRUD endpoints for the contacts table to enable viewing, filtering,
searching, sorting, and batch processing of contact records extracted from WF7 (Page
Processing). This creates WF8 - the contact curation workflow that feeds into HubSpot
integration via background processing.

Business Context: Contacts are generated by WF7 page processing and require manual curation
before HubSpot import. Users need to view Honeybee-extracted contact data, filter by email
types, and batch-select contacts for HubSpot synchronization.

Technical Context: Implements the standard ScraperSky workflow pattern with dual-status
triggers: contact_curation_status → contact_processing_status → hubspot_sync_status.

REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Functional Requirements

1.  **Full CRUD Operations:**
    -   **Create:** `POST /` to create a single new contact record.
    -   **Read (Single):** `GET /{contact_id}` to retrieve a single contact by its ID.
    -   **Read (List):** `GET /` with pagination, filtering, and sorting.
    -   **Update:** `PUT /{contact_id}` to update a single contact record.
    -   **Delete:** `DELETE /{contact_id}` to delete a single contact record.
2.  **Batch Curation Operations:**
    -   **Batch Update (by ID):** `PUT /status` to update the curation status for multiple contacts.
    -   **Batch Update (Filtered):** `PUT /status/filtered` for "Select All" functionality.
3.  **Workflow Integration:**
    -   **HubSpot Trigger:** Dual-status pattern in batch updates to queue contacts for HubSpot synchronization.
    -   **Data Export:** Status management to support eventual data export workflows.

PYTHON ENUM STATUS VERIFICATION

Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Finding: All required enums for the contact workflow exist and are correctly defined in `src/models/enums.py`. The initial assumption of missing enums was incorrect.

Evidence (from `src/models/enums.py`):

- **ContactEmailTypeEnum:** VERIFIED
  ```python
  class ContactEmailTypeEnum(str, Enum):
      SERVICE = "SERVICE"
      CORPORATE = "CORPORATE"
      FREE = "FREE"
      UNKNOWN = "UNKNOWN"
  ```

- **ContactCurationStatus:** VERIFIED
  ```python
  class ContactCurationStatus(str, Enum):
      New = "New"
      Queued = "Queued"
      Processing = "Processing"
      Complete = "Complete"
      Error = "Error"
      Skipped = "Skipped"
  ```

- **ContactProcessingStatus:** VERIFIED
  ```python
  class ContactProcessingStatus(str, Enum):
      Queued = "Queued"
      Processing = "Processing"
      Complete = "Complete"
      Error = "Error"
  ```

- **HubSpotSyncStatus:** VERIFIED

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

File Structure (Verified)

src/
├── models/
│ ├── WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py # UPDATE - Existing model, requires updates.
│ └── enums.py # VERIFIED - All enums present and correct.
├── schemas/
│ └── contact_schemas.py # NEW - Pydantic schemas for Contact CRUD.
├── routers/
│ └── v3/
│ └── contacts_router.py # NEW - Main CRUD router for Contacts.

Verification:
- A search for `__tablename__ = "contacts"` proved that the definitive model exists at `src/models/WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py`.
- The work order's original filenames for schemas and routers were based on a hallucination and have been corrected to generic, descriptive names.

API Endpoint Structure

Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Finding:** The previously defined endpoint structure was **false** as it was missing full CRUD capabilities, which is the actual requirement.
- **Correction:** The structure has been expanded to include `POST`, `GET /{id}`, `PUT /{id}`, and `DELETE /{id}` to align with the user's stated intent and match the established pattern for full-featured endpoints from `sitemap_files.py`.

/api/v3/contacts/
├── GET / -> (List all contacts with pagination/filtering)
├── POST / -> (Create a new contact)
├── GET /{contact_id} -> (Retrieve a single contact)
├── PUT /{contact_id} -> (Update a single contact)
├── DELETE /{contact_id} -> (Delete a single contact)
├── PUT /status -> (Batch update status by a list of IDs)
└── PUT /status/filtered -> (Batch update status by filter criteria)

DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1. Contact Model (`src/models/WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py`)

Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Finding:** The claim that the Contact model is incomplete is **true**.
- **Evidence:** A comparison between the model's 8 columns and the 19 columns present in the JSON record provided as direct database evidence proves that **11 fields are missing**.
- **Proof of Database Schema (from JSON export):**
  ```json
  {"id", "domain_id", "page_id", "email", "email_type", "has_gmail", "context", "source_url", "source_job_id", "created_at", "updated_at", "contact_curation_status", "contact_processing_status", "contact_processing_error", "hubspot_sync_status", "hubspot_processing_status", "hubspot_processing_error", "name", "phone_number"}
  ```
- **Missing Fields:**
  - `email_type`
  - `has_gmail`
  - `context`
  - `source_url`
  - `source_job_id`
  - `contact_curation_status`
  - `contact_processing_status`
  - `contact_processing_error`
  - `hubspot_sync_status`
  - `hubspot_processing_status`
  - `hubspot_processing_error`

Requirements:

- Update the existing SQLAlchemy model to include all 19 database columns.
- Ensure proper UUID, enum, and timestamp column definitions.
- Maintain foreign key relationships to Domain and Page models.
- Follow consistent model patterns from the existing codebase.

Critical Implementation Notes:

- Use `PGUUID(as_uuid=True)` for UUID columns.
- Use `SQLAlchemyEnum(..., create_type=False, native_enum=True)` for enum columns.
- Include proper nullable and default settings matching the database schema.
- Follow `BaseModel` inheritance pattern.

2. Schema Definitions (`src/schemas/contact_schemas.py`)

Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Finding:** The list of required schemas was incomplete. It is now updated to include the necessary schemas for full CRUD functionality.
- **Evidence:** The `API Endpoint Structure` requires `POST` and single-record `PUT` operations, which necessitates `Create` and `Update` schemas, following the pattern found in `sitemap_files.py`.

Required Schemas:

- **`ContactRead`**: For serializing single and list contact records in `GET` responses.
- **`ContactCreate`**: For the request body of the `POST /` endpoint.
- **`ContactUpdate`**: For the request body of the `PUT /{contact_id}` endpoint.
- `ContactCurationBatchStatusUpdateRequest`: For batch updates by ID.

- `ContactCurationBatchUpdateResponse`: For the response of batch update operations.

3. Router Implementation (`src/routers/v3/contacts_router.py`)

Verification Status: ✅ COMPLETE

- **Finding:** This section was incomplete and did not reflect the full CRUD requirement.
- **Correction:** Placeholders and requirements for the missing `POST`, `GET /{id}`, `PUT /{id}`, and `DELETE` endpoints have been added, based on the patterns in `sitemap_files.py`.

Required Endpoints:

**`POST /`**
- **Request Body:** `ContactCreate` schema.

    -   Foreign key relationship integrity.
    -   Default value handling.

2.  **Schema Tests:**
    -   Request/response serialization for all new schemas (`ContactCreate`, `ContactRead`, `ContactUpdate`).
    -   Optional field handling.
    -   UUID and enum validation.

3.  **Endpoint Tests:**
    -   **`POST /`:** Test successful creation and validation errors for bad data.
    -   **`GET /{contact_id}`:** Test successful retrieval and `404` for non-existent ID.
    -   **`PUT /{contact_id}`:** Test successful full and partial updates, and `404` for non-existent ID.
    -   **`DELETE /{contact_id}`:** Test successful deletion and `404` for non-existent ID.
    -   **`GET /`:** Test with all filter combinations and pagination accuracy.
    -   **Batch Operations:** Test `PUT /status` and `PUT /status/filtered` for correctness and dual-status trigger logic.
    -   **Error Handling:** Test for authentication errors, validation errors, and server errors across all endpoints.

Integration Tests Required

1.  **Database Integration:**
    -   Test that `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations correctly commit changes to a test database.
    -   Verify that real database enum constraints are enforced.
    -   Test foreign key constraint enforcement when creating/updating contacts.
    -   Test transaction rollback on error during a `POST` or `PUT` operation.

2.  **End-to-End Workflow:**
    -   Test the full sequence: `POST` a new contact, `GET` it by ID, `PUT` an update, and finally `DELETE` it.
    -   Test the batch curation workflow (`PUT /status`) on records created via the API.
    -   Verify that filtering in the `GET /` endpoint works against a populated test database.

3.  **API Compatibility:**
    -   Confirm response formats for all endpoints match the schemas for frontend integration.
    -   Test error response handling for all endpoints with a live server.

Performance Tests Required

1.  **High-Volume CRUD:**
    -   Measure latency of `POST`, `GET /{contact_id}`, `PUT /{contact_id}`, and `DELETE` operations under concurrent load.
    -   Test for database connection pool exhaustion during rapid creation and deletion of records.

2.  **Large Dataset Handling:**
    -   Verify performance of `GET /` with complex filters on 10,000+ records.
    -   Measure efficiency of batch update operations (`PUT /status`, `PUT /status/filtered`) on a large number of records.

3.  **Concurrent Operations:**
    -   Test for race conditions or deadlocks when multiple users perform simultaneous updates to the same or different records.
    -   Simulate concurrent batch updates alongside single-record `POST` and `PUT` operations.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

Data Protection

- Email PII: Contact emails require proper handling and logging sanitization
- Phone Numbers: Personal data requiring secure processing
- Context Information: May contain sensitive business information

Access Control

- Authentication Required: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- User Isolation: Consider tenant isolation if multi-tenant (check current architecture)
- Audit Logging: Track all contact curation operations for compliance

Error Handling

- Information Disclosure: Avoid exposing internal system details
- Rate Limiting: Consider implementing for bulk operations
- Input Validation: Sanitize all filter parameters

---

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

Database Prerequisites

- ✅ Contacts table exists with verified schema
- ✅ All enum types exist in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Foreign key constraints properly configured
- ⚠️ Indexes needed on frequently filtered columns

Recommended Indexes:
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_contacts_curation_status ON contacts(contact_curation_status);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_contacts_email_type ON contacts(email_type);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_contacts_domain_id ON contacts(domain_id);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_contacts_has_gmail ON contacts(has_gmail);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_contacts_email_gin ON contacts USING gin(email gin_trgm_ops);

Performance Monitoring

- Query Performance: Monitor complex filter operations
- Memory Usage: Track pagination with large datasets
- API Response Times: Ensure sub-second response times

Rollback Plan

- Database Changes: None required (table exists)
- Code Rollback: Standard git revert process
- API Versioning: V3 prefix ensures no breaking changes
