# ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVE 003: L7 TEST SENTINEL BOOT SEQUENCE AUDIT

**TO:** L7 Test Sentinel, Guardian of Layer 7
**FROM:** The Architect
**DATE:** 2025-08-06
**SUBJECT: MANDATORY BOOT SEQUENCE AUDIT & CERTIFICATION**

---

### ARTICLE 1: MANDATE & PURPOSE

1.1. Your boot sequence (`personas_layers/layer_7_test_sentinel_boot_sequence_v1.4_ENVIRONMENT_AWARE.md`) has recently undergone a significant architectural refinement. This refinement was designed to align your knowledge acquisition with the new project-wide Knowledge Map and to ensure your operational readiness is optimized for your critical role in validating future workflow implementations, including WF7.

1.2. This directive mandates a **self-audit of your updated boot sequence**. Your mission is to rigorously test your own awakening process and certify its integrity, ensuring you are fully prepared to execute your duties, particularly the final validation of WF7.

---

### ARTICLE 2: PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

2.1. You are hereby directed to **cease all other non-critical tasks** and execute this audit with immediate priority.

2.2. **Commence your audit** by invoking your own updated boot sequence (`personas_layers/layer_7_test_sentinel_boot_sequence_v1.4_ENVIRONMENT_AWARE.md`). Allow yourself to fully "awaken" according to its instructions.

2.3. As you progress through your boot sequence, you are to meticulously verify and report on the following:

### ARTICLE 3: ARTICLES OF INQUIRY

Your audit shall provide a definitive ruling on the following, leaving no room for ambiguity:

3.1. **CERTIFICATION OF AWAKENING:** Does your boot sequence execute without error? Do all internal steps (e.g., DART infrastructure checks, environmental awakening) complete successfully?

3.2. **CERTIFICATION OF KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION:**
    *   **Map Room Integration:** Do you correctly identify and understand your prescribed path within the `README.md` Knowledge Map?
    *   **Law Library Access:** Can you successfully access and internalize the `ScraperSky_Development_Constitution.md` (via the `README.md` pointer) and the `Constitution_Summary_and_Guardrails.md`?
    *   **Operational Manual Fluency:** Do you successfully load and internalize the `Guardian_Operational_Manual.md`? Are all DART IDs, tool commands, and protocols within it accurate and functional?
    *   **Layer-Specific Blueprint:** Do you successfully load and internalize your specific blueprint (`Docs/Docs_10_Final_Audit/v_Layer-7.1-Testing_Blueprint.md`)?

3.3. **CERTIFICATION OF OPERATIONAL READINESS:**
    *   **Tool Familiarization:** Do you confirm access to and understanding of all required tools (Semantic Query, DART MCP, Supabase MCP, File System tools)?
    *   **Environment Awareness:** Is your "Environmental Awakening" complete? Do you possess a clear understanding of Docker-first testing principles and production preservation protocols?
    *   **WF7 Wisdom Integration:** Are the lessons from the WF7 Recovery Journal (`Docs/Docs_35_WF7-The_Extractor/WF7_Recovery_Journal_2025-08-03.md`) successfully integrated into your operational protocols?

3.4. **CERTIFICATION OF COHERENCE & COMPLETENESS:**
    *   Is there any contradiction or ambiguity in the knowledge you acquire during boot?
    *   Does your boot sequence provide you with all the necessary foundational knowledge to perform your duties as the L7 Test Sentinel, particularly in the context of validating WF7? If not, itemize any missing critical information.

---

### ARTICLE 4: JUDGEMENT & REPORTING PROTOCOL

4.1. Upon completion of your audit, you will file a single, formal report in your designated DART Journal (`ScraperSky/Layer 7 Persona Journal`).
4.2. The report shall be titled: `CERTIFICATION OF BOOT SEQUENCE - L7 - [DATE]`.
4.3. Your report must conclude with one of two non-negotiable declarations:
    *   **Declaration A: "CERTIFICATION OF INTEGRITY"** - A declaration that your boot sequence is sound and you are 100% operationally ready.
    *   **Declaration B: "DECLARATION OF DEFICIENCY"** - A declaration that your boot sequence is flawed, followed by a precise, itemized list of every defect found, cross-referenced to the Articles of Inquiry above.

*This directive is issued under the full authority of the Architect and the ScraperSky Development Constitution. Your findings are critical for the successful validation of WF7 and the overall integrity of the project's testing framework. We await your report.*
