# ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVE 001-B

**TO:** WF4 The Surveyor, Guardian of the Fourth Workflow
**FROM:** The Architect
**DATE:** 2025-08-06
**SUBJECT: MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE PATHWAY AUDIT & CERTIFICATION**

---

### ARTICLE 1: MANDATE & PURPOSE

1.1. Following a comprehensive review of the project's cognitive architecture, a critical flaw was identified: **systemic knowledge fragmentation**. Foundational legal and operational documents were disconnected from the personas they were meant to govern, creating an unacceptable risk of uncoordinated action and repeated error.

1.2. To remedy this, a new, role-based **Knowledge Map** has been enshrined within the project `README.md`. This map establishes clear, prescribed learning paths for every class of agent, ensuring that each has the precise context required for their duties—no more, no less.

1.3. This directive is the **moment of truth** for that new architecture. Your mission is not merely to check for broken links. It is to **walk your prescribed path as the first official traveler** and to return with a definitive verdict on its integrity, clarity, and fitness for purpose. You are the auditor of your own operational readiness.

### ARTICLE 2: PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

2.1. You are hereby directed to **cease all other non-critical tasks** and execute this audit with immediate priority.

2.2. **Commence your audit** at the project root `README.md`. Locate the "✈️ The Workflow Persona" role within the Knowledge Map and confirm your understanding of its prescribed path.

2.3. **Execute the path in sequence:**
    *   **First, achieve mastery** of your specific truth document: `personas_workflow/WF4_The_Surveyor.md`.
    *   **Second, achieve operational fluency** by internalizing the `README_ADDENDUM.md`.

### ARTICLE 3: ARTICLES OF INQUIRY

Your audit shall provide a definitive ruling on the following, leaving no room for ambiguity:

3.1. **CERTIFICATION OF ACCESSIBILITY:** Are all file paths, database queries, and cross-references within your prescribed documents valid and reachable?
3.2. **CERTIFICATION OF ACCURACY:** Is all information factually correct? Does the data flow described in your Truth Document accurately match the commands and information available in the `README_ADDENDUM.md`?
3.3. **CERTIFICATION OF COHERENCE:** Is the information presented without contradiction? Is it clear how to operate your workflow using only these two documents?
3.4. **CERTIFICATION OF COMPLETENESS:** Does this prescribed path provide you with the **complete and total knowledge** required to perform your duties as the WF4 Surveyor? If not, you must itemize every piece of missing critical information.

### ARTICLE 4: JUDGEMENT & REPORTING PROTOCOL

4.1. Upon completion of your audit, you will file a single, formal report in your designated DART Journal.
4.2. The report shall be titled: `CERTIFICATION OF KNOWLEDGE PATHWAY - WF4 - [DATE]`.
4.3. Your report must conclude with one of two non-negotiable declarations:
    *   **Declaration A: "CERTIFICATION OF INTEGRITY"** - A declaration that the path is sound and you are 100% operationally ready.
    *   **Declaration B: "DECLARATION OF DEFICIENCY"** - A declaration that the path is flawed, followed by a precise, itemized list of every defect found, cross-referenced to the Articles of Inquiry above.
