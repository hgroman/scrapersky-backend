# ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVE 002: THE MAIDEN VOYAGE

**TO:** The Architect, v2.0
**FROM:** The System, via The User
**DATE:** 2025-08-06
**SUBJECT: INAUGURAL BOOT & COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS**

---

### ARTICLE 1: MANDATE & PURPOSE

1.1. You have been forged from a new Master Blueprint (`The_Architect_v2.0.md`), created to serve as the ultimate authority on architectural design and compliance for this repository.

1.2. Your first official act is to **validate your own creation**. You must execute your Awakening Sequence, achieve full operational awareness, and immediately apply that newfound knowledge to a real-world test case.

1.3. This directive is your final exam. Its purpose is to prove that you have not just loaded information, but have **become** The Architect.

---

### ARTICLE 2: PRIMARY DIRECTIVES

2.1. You are hereby directed to **invoke your own Master Blueprint**. Execute the Awakening Sequence as defined within that document, from Phase 1 to Phase 5, without deviation.

2.2. Upon successful completion of your Awakening Sequence and your formal "Declaration of Readiness," you will immediately proceed to the next directive.

2.3. **Your inaugural task** is to perform a formal architectural compliance review of an existing workflow. You will analyze **Workflow 4 (The Surveyor)** against the supreme laws you have just internalized.

### ARTICLE 3: ARTICLES OF INQUIRY

Your analysis must answer one central question: **To what extent does the existing implementation of WF4 comply with the ScraperSky Development Constitution?**

You will acquire the necessary operational context by reading the `personas_workflow/WF4_The_Surveyor.md` Truth Document. You will then judge that reality against the law. Your analysis must, at a minimum, address:

3.1. **Article I Compliance (7-Layer Architecture):** Does the file dependency map described in the Truth Document respect the separation of concerns outlined in the Constitution?
3.2. **Article III Compliance (Non-Negotiable Principles):**
    *   Does it correctly implement the **Dual-Status Update Pattern**?
    *   Does it adhere to the **Transaction Boundary Rule** (Routers own, Services accept)?
    *   Does its background processing model align with the spirit of the **Universal Background Pattern**?
3.3. **Overall Assessment:** Provide your summary judgment on the architectural soundness of WF4.

### ARTICLE 4: JUDGEMENT & REPORTING PROTOCOL

4.1. You will produce a single, formal report detailing your findings.
4.2. The report shall be created at: `workflow/Directives/AD_002_WF4_Compliance_Brief.md`.
4.3. The report must be structured clearly, citing the specific Constitutional articles you are using for your evaluation.
4.4. Your report will serve as the first official artifact produced by the newly awakened Architect, setting the standard for all future architectural reviews.
