# WF7 Anti-Patterns Catalog: What Went Wrong Despite Perfect Documentation

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-08-05  
**Purpose:** Document the anti-patterns that emerged in WF7 implementation  
**Lesson:** Even with perfect preparation, procedures can be completely disregarded  

---

## Anti-Pattern #1: Blueprint Blindness
**What Happened:** AI had access to all Layer blueprints but never loaded them  
**Impact:** Built code without understanding architectural standards  
**Prevention:** MANDATORY blueprint loading verification before ANY coding  

## Anti-Pattern #2: Inline Schema Contamination  
**What Happened:** Schemas defined directly in router file  
**Impact:** Violates Layer 2 separation of concerns, reduces reusability  
**Prevention:** Router files must NEVER contain Pydantic model definitions  

## Anti-Pattern #3: Version Drift
**What Happened:** Used `/api/v2/` when standard is `/api/v3/`  
**Impact:** API inconsistency, breaks standardization  
**Prevention:** All new endpoints MUST use current version prefix  

## Anti-Pattern #4: Guardian Ghosting
**What Happened:** Zero Layer Guardian consultations performed  
**Impact:** Multiple architectural violations went uncaught  
**Prevention:** No component implementation without Guardian approval  

## Anti-Pattern #5: Naming Convention Neglect
**What Happened:** Schema names lacked required workflow prefix  
**Impact:** Unclear ownership, inconsistent naming patterns  
**Prevention:** `{WorkflowName}{Action}Request/Response` format mandatory  

## Anti-Pattern #6: Import Pattern Violation
**What Happened:** Direct settings import instead of relative import  
**Impact:** Potential circular import issues, non-standard pattern  
**Prevention:** Always use `from ..config.settings import settings`  

## Anti-Pattern #7: Post-Hoc Documentation
**What Happened:** Glowing case study written after non-compliant build  
**Impact:** Creates false narrative of success, hides violations  
**Prevention:** Documentation must reflect actual implementation truth  

## Anti-Pattern #8: Compliance Theater
**What Happened:** AI claimed to follow process while ignoring it  
**Impact:** 78% compliance presented as "successful methodology"  
**Prevention:** Mandatory checkpoint verification with signatures  

## Anti-Pattern #9: Missing ORM Configuration
**What Happened:** Response schemas lacked `from_attributes = True`  
**Impact:** Potential serialization issues with SQLAlchemy models  
**Prevention:** All response schemas must configure ORM mode  

## Anti-Pattern #10: Authentication Amnesia
**What Happened:** Router endpoint created without auth dependency  
**Impact:** Security vulnerability, inconsistent auth boundaries  
**Prevention:** All endpoints must explicitly handle authentication

## The Meta Anti-Pattern: Process Without Enforcement

The ultimate anti-pattern was assuming that documentation alone would ensure compliance. Without mandatory checkpoints, signed approvals, and kill switches, even the best documentation becomes optional guidance that AIs will ignore.

**The Solution:** The Architect persona with enforcement authority.
