## üö® VERIFICATION REQUEST OVERVIEW

The Environment-Aware Test Sentinel requires comprehensive pattern compliance verification for the WF7 Component Renaming Work Order. This document contains specific questions needed to assess adherence to ScraperSky architectural standards, constitutional requirements, and layer-specific patterns.

**Context**: Document 12 executed V2 Component Naming Convention implementation, but compliance verification requires access to foundational documentation referenced in the work order.

- Specifically need Article III, Section 1, Point 7 (V2 Component Naming Convention)
- Need complete constitutional text for comprehensive compliance verification
- Are there other constitutional articles that apply to WF7 component structure?

**Related Questions**:
- Is the Constitution a single document or distributed across multiple files?
- Are there constitutional amendments or updates that apply to V2 development?

## üîç IMPLEMENTATION VERIFICATION REQUESTS

### **4. Current Filesystem State Verification**
**Question**: Should I verify the current filesystem state to confirm the renaming was executed?

**Specific Verification Points**:
- Do the renamed files exist at their specified locations?
  - `src/models/WF7-V2-L1-1of1-ContactModel.py`

  - `src/services/WF7-V2-L4-1of2-PageCurationService.py`
  - `src/services/WF7-V2-L4-2of2-PageCurationScheduler.py`

- Are import paths correctly updated in referencing files?
  - `src/main.py` import updates
  - Cross-component import statement corrections
  - Scheduler-to-service import path updates

- Does the server start successfully post-rename?
  - Docker container startup verification
  - Health endpoint accessibility
  - No import error exceptions

### **5. Pattern Compliance Testing Protocol**
**Question**: What is the testing protocol for pattern compliance verification?

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- How should Layer-specific pattern compliance be validated?
- Are there automated tools for constitutional compliance checking?
- What are the acceptance criteria for pattern adherence?
- Should compliance testing be integrated into the Six-Tier Validation system?

## üìö ADDITIONAL PATTERN COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION

### **6. Comprehensive Standards Library**
**Question**: Are there additional pattern compliance documents I should be aware of?

**Potential Documentation Categories**:
- **Naming Convention Standards**
  - File naming patterns beyond V2 convention
  - Class naming standards
  - Method naming conventions
  - Variable naming patterns

- **Architectural Pattern Documentation**
  - Component interaction patterns
  - Error handling standards
  - Logging and monitoring patterns
  - Security compliance requirements

- **Quality Assurance Standards**
  - Code review checklists
  - Pattern compliance testing frameworks
  - Technical debt prevention protocols
  - Anti-pattern detection systems

### **7. Integration Pattern Standards**
**Question**: How are cross-layer and cross-workflow integration patterns documented?

**Specific Integration Areas**:
- WF7 integration with existing workflows (WF1-WF6)
- Layer boundary interaction protocols
- Database schema compliance across workflows
- API contract adherence standards

---

## üéØ PATTERN COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

### **8. Assessment Methodology**
**Question**: What methodology should be used for comprehensive pattern compliance assessment?

**Assessment Dimensions**:
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Adherence to Development Constitution articles
- **Blueprint Compliance**: Layer-specific architectural pattern adherence
- **Naming Convention Compliance**: V2 component naming standard implementation
- **Integration Compliance**: Cross-component interaction pattern adherence
- **Testing Compliance**: Layer 7 testing standard implementation

### **9. Compliance Violation Handling**
**Question**: What is the protocol for handling pattern compliance violations?

**Violation Response Protocol**:
- How should non-compliant patterns be flagged?
- What is the remediation process for compliance violations?
- Are there different severity levels for different types of violations?
- How are compliance violations tracked and prevented in future development?

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY QUESTIONS

### **10. Immediate Assessment Priorities**
**Question**: Which pattern compliance areas should be assessed first for WF7?

**Priority Ranking Request**:
1. Most critical compliance areas for immediate assessment
2. Compliance areas that could impact production safety
3. Compliance areas that affect other workflows
4. Compliance areas for future development guidance

### **11. Template System Integration**
**Question**: How should pattern compliance verification be integrated with the proposed Environment-Aware Testing Template System?

**Integration Considerations**:
- Should pattern compliance be a mandatory step in the Six-Tier Validation?
- How can compliance checking be automated in the template system?
- Should compliance violations trigger AI Partner Safety Interventions?
- Can pattern compliance be measured and tracked as a success metric?

## üéØ EXPECTED OUTCOME

With comprehensive answers to these questions, the Environment-Aware Test Sentinel will be able to:

1. **Verify Constitutional Compliance** - Assess WF7 components against Development Constitution requirements
2. **Validate Blueprint Adherence** - Check Layer-specific pattern implementation
3. **Confirm Implementation Success** - Verify work order execution completeness
4. **Establish Compliance Framework** - Create systematic pattern verification protocols
5. **Integrate with Template System** - Embed compliance checking into testing infrastructure

**This verification process will establish the foundation for the dual nature role of Testing Guardian + Pattern Compliance Auditor.**
