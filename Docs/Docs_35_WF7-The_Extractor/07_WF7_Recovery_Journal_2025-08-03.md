# WF7 Recovery Journal - August 3, 2025

## The Problem
WF7 was implemented successfully but contained basic import errors that prevented server startup.

## Root Causes
1. **Import assumptions without verification** - Used `get_settings()` function that didn't exist
2. **Enum import from wrong module** - Tried importing `ContactEmailTypeEnum` from `contact.py` instead of `enums.py`  
3. **Missing dependency** - `crawl4ai` package not installed
4. **No testing during implementation** - Server startup was never verified

## The Fixes
```python
# 1. Settings import (page_curation_scheduler.py:4)
- from src.config.settings import get_settings
+ from src.config.settings import settings

# 2. Enum import (email_scraper.py:15-16)  
- from ..models.contact import Contact, ContactEmailTypeEnum
+ from ..models.contact import Contact
+ from ..models.enums import ContactEmailTypeEnum

# 3. Missing dependency
pip install crawl4ai
```

## Key Lessons
- **Always verify imports exist before using them**
- **Test server startup after every major change**
- **Check existing codebase patterns before writing new code**
- **Install dependencies during implementation, not after**

## Development Protocol
```bash
# After any import changes, always run:
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000

# If successful, test basic connectivity:
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Final Outcome
✅ Server starts successfully  
✅ All imports resolved  
✅ WF7 functionality ready for testing  

## Time Impact
- **3+ hours of debugging** across multiple AI sessions
- **Confusion and conflicting analyses** due to misleading error documentation
- **Complete development blockage** until resolution

## Prevention
The entire crisis could have been prevented with **5 minutes of testing** during initial implementation.
