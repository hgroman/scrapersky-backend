ScraperSky Pattern Vectorization Expansion
Executive Summary
Implement AST-Guided Chunking: Extract code patterns by parsing code into logical blocks (functions, classes, SQL queries) instead of arbitrary text splits. Use Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) or concrete syntax trees to chunk code at natural boundaries (function definitions, class scopes, etc.), preserving context like imports or surrounding comments
discuss.huggingface.co
qodo.ai
. Aim for chunks ~200–300 tokens each (about 1000 characters) as a starting point
unstructured.io
, with slight overlaps to avoid breaking context. This produces semantically meaningful code snippets for embedding, improving pattern recognition and search relevance.
Leverage Specialized Code Embeddings: Use OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 (1536-dimension) for robust general-purpose code/text embeddings
supabase.com
. Compare with code-specific models: e.g. OpenAI’s retired code-search-babbage-001 (trained for code/text search) or open-source Instructor-XL which has shown higher semantic search performance than Ada in benchmarks
reddit.com
reddit.com
. Favor models that capture coding semantics (control flow, API usage) – for example, nomic-ai’s embed-code or CodeT5+ embedding – if OpenAI costs are a concern, ensuring they output vectors compatible with pgvector (embedding dimensions up to 2000 are supported).
Enrich Vector Metadata: Define a rich schema for the pattern vectors. Include fields like pattern_name (descriptive label, e.g. "Long Parameter List"), severity (e.g. "critical", "minor"), tags (categories like “security”, “performance”), layer (architectural layer or module), file_path, line_start, line_end, and commit_hash. This metadata enables filtered queries (e.g. only show critical security anti-patterns) and helps map results back to code. For each identified pattern instance, store its snippet embedding along with these labels. This lays the groundwork for targeted technical debt tracking (e.g. counting occurrences of each pattern over time) and context-aware suggestions in the IDE.
Optimize pgvector for Code Search: Use cosine distance for similarity (pgvector’s vector_cosine_ops) as it works well with embeddings (vector magnitudes won’t skew similarity)
neon.com
. Configure approximate indexes for scalability: for <100K code vectors, an IVFFlat index with ~√N lists (or lists = table_rows/1000 for up to 1M rows
tembo.io
) is a good start, paired with SET ivfflat.probes = sqrt(lists) to balance recall/speed
tembo.io
. For larger datasets or higher recall, use HNSW indexing: e.g. USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (m=16, ef_construction=64)
neon.com
. Tune HNSW’s m (graph connectivity) and ef_search (search effort, default 40) to trade off speed vs. recall
tembo.io
tembo.io
. This yields sub-second semantic searches even as code scale grows.
Integrate Continuous Ingestion & Feedback: Extend the existing FastAPI pipeline to continuously monitor the repo and vectorize new patterns. Integrate a CI hook or cron job to run the pattern extractor on code changes (e.g. on each merge to main) – “commit code → embed patterns → update DB” – so the index is always fresh
qodo.ai
fullvibes.dev
. Provide lightweight REST endpoints (/search_vectors, /get_pattern/<id>) that IDE plugins (Windsurf, Cursor, etc.) call to retrieve relevant pattern info with minimal payload (e.g. just pattern name, location, and a brief description). Capture user feedback from the IDE (thumbs-up/down on suggestions) via a /feedback endpoint, and log these events. Use this feedback to refine results ranking (e.g. boost patterns that developers confirm as helpful, suppress those frequently dismissed). Instrument the pipeline with logging or Postgres tables to track usage (queries per day, top searched patterns) and employ Grafana/Prometheus on query metrics for visibility. Over time, analyze pattern frequency trends (via SQL queries or dashboards) to quantify technical debt – e.g. a rising count of a “Deprecated API Use” pattern signals debt accruing, informing the team where refactoring is needed.
1. Pattern Identification & Vectorization
Extracting Code Patterns: Start by scanning the codebase for known patterns and anti-patterns. This can be rule-based (e.g. static analysis for “code smells”) and/or ML-driven. For known issues (like overly broad exception handlers or SQL queries without parameterization), use linters or regex/AST matchers to flag instances. For more complex patterns, leverage AI: convert code to an intermediate form (AST) and cluster embeddings to discover recurring structures. AI-driven tools can detect “smells” by learning what normal code looks like and finding outliers
fullvibes.dev
fullvibes.dev
 – e.g. an unusually long function or a copy-pasted code block might appear as an embedding that is distant from others (an anomaly). Each identified instance becomes a candidate “pattern vector” with an initial label (either a known pattern name or a short description if novel). Intelligent Chunking: Unlike plain text, code has syntax and structure that should guide chunking. Use AST-based chunking to ensure each chunk is a self-contained logical unit
discuss.huggingface.co
. For Python, for example, parse files and extract functions, class methods, and code blocks as separate chunks. This preserves semantic context (function name, parameters, docstrings) which aids the embedding model in capturing meaning. Avoid splitting a function across chunks if possible – if a function is very large, consider splitting at logical sub-blocks (e.g. major loops or if/else blocks) and include a few overlapping lines for continuity. The Sweep AI method (open-sourced and adopted by LlamaIndex) uses a concrete syntax tree to chunk code cohesively
qodo.ai
. Starting from such approaches, verify that chunks aren’t missing vital context like import statements or surrounding class definitions
qodo.ai
. Aim for chunk sizes on the order of a few hundred tokens. In practice, ~250 tokens per chunk is a sensible default
unstructured.io
 – this is well below Ada-002’s 8192-token limit but large enough to encompass a medium-sized function or paragraph of documentation. Smaller chunks improve retrieval precision by being more focused
unstructured.io
. Use overlapping boundaries (e.g. 1-2 lines overlap) when splitting a long code block to avoid losing context at the edges. Embedding Strategy: Once chunks are prepared, encode them into vectors. OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 is a strong choice for code and natural language, outputting 1536-dimensional embeddings
supabase.com
 that capture semantic similarity. (OpenAI reports ada-002 outperforms their earlier code-specific models in code search tasks
openai.com
.) Each code chunk – whether Python, SQL, or Markdown – should be preprocessed (e.g. replace newlines with spaces as recommended
supabase.com
) and sent to the embedding API. For example, a Python function embedding might represent not just keywords, but the intent of the code. Notably, OpenAI embeddings are universal, so you can embed code and queries with the same model to enable semantic code search
openai.com
. For potentially better code understanding, evaluate open-source models like Instructor-XL or E5 embeddings. Community benchmarks (MTEB) have shown Instructor-XL can exceed ada-002 on semantic tasks
reddit.com
. However, note that Instructor-XL has a shorter input limit (~512 tokens) than Ada-002’s 8192
news.ycombinator.com
, which could constrain large code chunks. If using open-source models, you could self-host them and still store vectors in pgvector. Ensure the embedding dimensionality (e.g. 768 for many HuggingFace models, 1024 for CodeBERT, etc.) is set as the vector column length. Each pattern vector should be stored along with descriptive metadata. For example, a vector for a SQL anti-pattern chunk might carry pattern_name='SQL Injection Risk', severity='high', tags=['security','database'], file_path='app/db/util.py', line_start=50, line_end=75, and the commit_hash identifying the code version. Including such metadata enables powerful querying (filter by tag or severity) and linking results back to code locations. It’s often useful to embed a short natural language summary of the code chunk as well (either as part of the chunk text or separately) – e.g. “Function update_user – opens DB transaction, concatenates SQL query from params (potential SQL injection)” – which an LLM can generate. Storing that summary or pattern description can later be used in prompts to the IDE assistant, saving tokens by not always including raw code.
2. Supabase pgvector Configuration
Table & Schema Setup: Using Supabase’s Postgres with pgvector means you can define a table that holds both metadata and the embedding vector. For example:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE code_patterns (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  pattern_name text,
  severity text,
  tags text[],
  layer text,
  file_path text,
  line_start int,
  line_end int,
  commit_hash text,
  embedding vector(1536)  -- 1536 dims for ada-002 embeddings
);
This schema reserves a 1536-length vector column for Ada-002 embeddings
supabase.com
 (adjust dimensions if using a different model). The text and numeric columns store metadata alongside each vector for filtering and identification. You might also create separate tables for patterns vs. plain documentation code embeddings, but given the moderate size of your data, a single code_patterns table with appropriate indexing is fine. Distance Metric: pgvector supports cosine distance, inner product, and Euclidean (L2) distance
neon.com
. Cosine distance is recommended for embeddings like Ada-002, since the absolute vector norms are less important than direction. By creating the index with vector_cosine_ops, the <-> operator in queries will compute cosine distance. (Inner product could also work if all vectors are normalized; Ada-002 outputs are not normalized by default, but you could L2-normalize them before insert to treat dot product as equivalent to cosine similarity.) Indexing Strategies: For performant similarity search, especially as the number of pattern vectors grows, create an approximate nearest neighbor index. Two good options are IVFFlat and HNSW:
IVFFlat (Inverted File Index): Clusters the vectors into a number of lists (partitions) and limits search to a few relevant clusters. You specify lists when creating the index. For example, if you expect on the order of 100k pattern vectors, you might start with around 100 lists (or use pgvector’s guidance: lists = table_rows/1000 up to 1M rows, then ~√rows for larger)
tembo.io
. Create the index as:
sql
Copy
CREATE INDEX ON code_patterns 
  USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
After populating data, you can tune the search accuracy by setting the number of probes at query time: SET ivfflat.probes = 10; (a good default is √lists
tembo.io
, so ~10 in this case, to balance speed and recall). Higher probes means searching more clusters for better recall, at the cost of latency
tembo.io
.
HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph): Builds a multi-layer graph of vector neighbors for very fast search. HNSW tends to give higher recall at a given speed than IVFFlat, especially for high-dimensional data, at the cost of a larger index memory footprint. Create it as:
sql
Copy
CREATE INDEX ON code_patterns 
  USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
Here m is the number of connections per node (graph degree) and ef_construction controls index build accuracy
neon.com
neon.com
. The defaults (m=16, ef=64) are reasonable if you’re unsure
tembo.io
. At query time, you can set SET hnsw.ef_search = 40; (pgvector’s default) or higher for better recall
tembo.io
 – increasing ef_search lets the search algorithm explore more neighbors. HNSW indexes do not require choosing “probes” like IVFFlat, but you should monitor recall (accuracy of results) and adjust ef_search upward if needed to ensure you’re not missing relevant patterns
tembo.io
.
For relatively small-scale use (a few thousand vectors), even a brute-force sequential scan with a regular GIN-index (or no index) might be acceptable, but as usage grows, the above indexes will ensure queries remain fast (HNSW is sub-linear search time). Tip: Always enable the vector extension in your database (CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;) before creating these indexes
github.com
. Annotated Example – Table and Index DDL: Below is a concise example putting this together (with commentary):
sql
Copy
-- Enable pgvector extension (if not already done in Supabase)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

-- Table for pattern embeddings
CREATE TABLE code_patterns (
  id bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  pattern_name TEXT,
  severity TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  file_path TEXT,
  line_start INT,
  line_end INT,
  commit_hash TEXT,
  embedding VECTOR(1536)  -- Ada-002 embeddings are 1536-dim:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}
);

-- HNSW index for fast cosine similarity search on embeddings
CREATE INDEX code_patterns_hnsw_idx 
  ON code_patterns USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
  WITH (m=16, ef_construction=64);  -- defaults for HNSW:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}

-- Alternatively, an IVFFlat index (if dataset grows large)
CREATE INDEX code_patterns_ivfflat_idx 
  ON code_patterns USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
  WITH (lists=100);  -- e.g. 100 clusters for ~100k rows:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}

-- (Remember to ANALYZE after large inserts to help the query planner)
With this setup, a typical query to find similar code patterns would look like:
sql
Copy
SELECT id, pattern_name, file_path, 1 - (embedding <=> $1) AS similarity 
FROM code_patterns 
WHERE pattern_name != 'Documentation' 
ORDER BY embedding <=> $1 
LIMIT 5;
Here $1 is a parameter: a query embedding vector (e.g. for a snippet or question). We use the <=> operator which pgvector defines as the distance (lower is closer); ordering by it ascending finds nearest vectors. The expression 1 - distance gives a similarity score from 0–1 for convenience
supabase.com
supabase.com
. By filtering (WHERE pattern_name != 'Documentation' or by severity etc.) you can scope the search if needed. Note: When using an ANN index (IVFFlat/HNSW) with additional filters, pgvector may return fewer than the limit if some nearest vectors are filtered out
supabase.com
supabase.com
. If exact recall is needed with filters, you might implement iterative searching
supabase.com
 or accept slightly fewer results.
3. Ingestion Pipeline Design
Augmenting the Pipeline: Your current document ingestion pipeline (registry scanning, vectorizing docs via OpenAI, etc.) can be extended with a new stage for code pattern detection. One approach is to integrate this into the existing scan loop: when the scanner encounters code files (e.g. .py, .sql, .md in your repo), instead of treating them as plain docs, route them through a pattern extractor. This extractor could be a Python module that runs after the file is read but before embedding generation:
Parse the file’s AST (for code) or structure (for Markdown). Identify logical units (functions, classes, headings, etc.).
For each unit, apply pattern rules or LLM prompts to decide if it matches a known pattern or smells of an anti-pattern. For example, a Python function with too many parameters or local variables might be labeled "Long Method" (complexity smell). A SQL string concatenation might be labeled "SQL Injection Risk". Units that don’t match any known issue can still be embedded (they might represent common patterns or even good patterns that can be referenced).
Create an entry in a new code_patterns registry or reuse the document_registry with a subtype. Mark it with an embedding_status='queue' similar to docs, so the vectorization engine picks it up.
Vectorization & Upsert: The vectorization script (e.g. your insert_architectural_docs.py) can be generalized to handle both documentation chunks and code pattern chunks. It would query the registry for any items (doc or code) with embedding_status='queue', generate the embedding via OpenAI, and upsert into the respective table. For patterns, you’ll insert into code_patterns table. Since pattern vectors might be updated if code changes, use an upsert (ON CONFLICT) or versioning:
Upsert strategy: Use a primary key that’s stable (perhaps the combination of file_path and line_start or an id derived from content hash) so that if the same pattern is re-embedded (after code changes), it updates the existing row. Alternatively, always insert new and mark old ones as archived via a flag or move them to a history table with the old commit_hash.
Versioning strategy: Use commit_hash to differentiate entries. If code changes, a new row with a new commit hash is added, and you can later analyze if the pattern persists or was fixed.
Example Code Snippet: Below is a simplified illustration of how you might integrate pattern ingestion in Python using FastAPI and asyncpg (assuming you have the OpenAI API key configured):
python
Copy
import asyncpg, openai
from pgvector.asyncpg import register_vector

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@host/db"

async def process_patterns():
    conn = await asyncpg.connect(DATABASE_URL)
    await register_vector(conn)  # enable vector type for asyncpg:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}
    # Fetch code chunks pending embedding
    rows = await conn.fetch(
        "SELECT id, file_path, code_snippet, pattern_name, severity, tags "
        "FROM document_registry WHERE type='code_pattern' AND embedding_status='queue';"
    )
    for r in rows:
        snippet = r['code_snippet']
        # Generate embedding from OpenAI
        response = openai.Embedding.create(model="text-embedding-ada-002", input=snippet)
        vector = response['data'][0]['embedding']
        # Upsert into code_patterns table
        await conn.execute(
            "INSERT INTO code_patterns (id, pattern_name, severity, tags, file_path, line_start, line_end, commit_hash, embedding) "
            "VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9) "
            "ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET embedding=$9, commit_hash=$8, severity=$3, tags=$4;",
            r['id'], r['pattern_name'], r['severity'], r['tags'], 
            r['file_path'],  r.get('line_start', 0), r.get('line_end', 0), 
            current_commit_hash(), vector
        )
        # Mark as processed in registry
        await conn.execute(
            "UPDATE document_registry SET embedding_status='active' WHERE id=$1;", r['id']
        )
    await conn.close()
In this snippet, we fetch queued code pattern snippets from the document_registry (assuming you mark them similarly to docs). We call OpenAI’s embedding endpoint for each (the code replaces newlines internally as needed). After obtaining the vector, we do an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT to either add a new pattern or update the existing one if the id already exists (conflict target here is id, which we assume is a stable identifier for that code snippet pattern). We update the registry to mark it active. This is an asynchronous function; in a real app, you might run it periodically or as part of a background task in the FastAPI app. Continuous Integration & Automation: To keep the vector database in sync with the code:
CI Pipeline: Add a step in your CI (e.g. GitHub Actions or Render deploy script) that runs the pattern extraction and embedding update. For example, after tests pass on a new commit to main, trigger a management command or API call that runs process_patterns for any new patterns. This ensures new code is indexed before hitting production.
Cron Job: On your Render or wherever the backend runs, schedule a cron (or use a library like APScheduler in FastAPI) to periodically scan the repo for changes. This could simply pull the latest repository state and run a diff against the last indexed commit. If new commits are found, re-run the ingestion on changed files. (Storing commit_hash in the table helps to know what’s already processed.)
Git Hooks (pre-commit or post-commit): For local awareness (developers getting immediate feedback), you could provide a pre-commit git hook that runs a lightweight pattern scan on changed files and perhaps warns the developer if they are introducing a known anti-pattern (this doesn’t replace the server-side embedding, but gives quick feedback). A post-commit hook on the repository server could also send a message (webhook) to the FastAPI service to run an update.
By integrating with CI/CD, you turn the vector store into a living index of the codebase’s patterns. New patterns are available for search in near real-time, and obsolete ones (e.g. a code smell that got refactored away) can be flagged by noticing its commit hash is old compared to the latest code. For example, if a pattern’s last seen commit is 5 releases ago, maybe it’s been resolved and that vector could be downgraded in priority or archived. Data Validation: Since this pipeline involves automated tagging, it’s important to validate that the patterns identified are correct. You could maintain a YAML or JSON list of known patterns with their criteria (for transparency), and occasionally have developers review a sample of matches. If an LLM is used to label patterns, consider adding a manual verification step for anything flagged “critical” before treating it as truth. In the database, include a boolean confirmed or a confidence score, so the UI could highlight unconfirmed patterns differently.
4. IDE & AI Integration
API Endpoints Design: With vectors and metadata in place, you can now serve them to IDE plugins to provide live assistance. Two key endpoints can be:
GET /search_vectors?q=<query>&filters=<...> – This endpoint accepts a search query (which could be natural language like “find duplicate code for X” or a code snippet example). The server will embed the query (using the same Ada-002 model for consistency) and perform a vector similarity search in the code_patterns table. You can allow optional filters, e.g. filters={"severity":"high","layer":"backend"} to narrow results. The response should include a ranked list of pattern matches, each with minimal info: e.g. pattern_id, pattern_name, similarity score, and maybe a short snippet or summary. Crucially, do not send full code blobs in this response – keep it lightweight. The IDE can then call the next endpoint to get details for any specific pattern of interest.
GET /get_pattern/<id> – This returns the details for a single pattern vector. Given a pattern_id, retrieve its metadata and the relevant snippet of code or a prepared explanation. This might include file_path and line_span so the IDE can display the code to the user in context, and perhaps a one-liner description (if you stored a summary or can derive one). If the snippet is short (few lines), you might include it here; if it's long, consider just linking to the file in the repository (so the IDE can open it) to save payload.
By splitting search and fetch, you keep the initial search results small (just names and scores). The plugin can lazily fetch the actual content for the top suggestion or when the user requests details, saving tokens and bandwidth. Token-Efficient Prompts: When the IDE (Cursor, Windsurf, RooCode, etc.) integrates these suggestions into an LLM prompt (for code completion or explanation), we want to minimize token usage:
Summarize patterns instead of raw code: Instead of injecting a 50-line code snippet into ChatGPT’s context, inject a concise description. For instance, if a search finds a known anti-pattern “Long Parameter List” in function foo(bar, baz, …) with 12 parameters, the plugin can prompt the LLM with: “Note: function foo() has a Long Parameter List code smell (12 parameters) which may indicate need for refactoring.” This conveys the issue in one sentence rather than copying all parameter names. You can prepare these summaries automatically. For example, store a template for each pattern_name explaining it. In this case: “Long Parameter List: Function with too many parameters, which can make testing and maintenance harder.” Then fill in specifics (like the count or function name).
Use metadata to scope context: If the developer is currently editing a file util/db.py, use that context to filter or prioritize patterns from the same module or directory. The plugin might call /search_vectors with a filter like file_path LIKE 'util/%' or simply boost those results on the client side. This ensures the suggestions are relevant to the code in focus, reducing noise.
Limit number of vector results in prompts: It’s tempting to dump, say, 5 related code examples into the prompt to give the LLM more context. But too many examples can overwhelm the context window (and even confuse the model). A good strategy is to include 1–3 of the highest-similarity patterns. Empirically, the top 2 results often provide sufficient guidance. For instance, if the developer is writing a SQL query, the system might fetch the two most similar past SQL snippets (one good, one with an anti-pattern) and only include short highlights or differences. The prompt might say: “The current query is similar to a known safe query pattern (using parameterized queries) and dissimilar to an insecure pattern (string concatenation in SQL).” This gives the model a hint to follow the secure pattern.
Prefetch and cache embeddings: To keep interactions snappy, consider caching the user’s query embedding for a short time. If the user is in an active session and repeatedly searching or the plugin is proactively fetching suggestions as they type, avoid re-embedding the same context repeatedly. OpenAI embeddings are fast, but at scale caching can save latency and cost. Supabase’s edge functions or the FastAPI server can do caching in memory or using an LRU for recent queries (perhaps keyed by a hash of the query string).
Embedding Filtering & Ranking: Not all vector search results should be treated equal. Some post-processing can improve the quality of suggestions:
Similarity threshold: Decide a minimum cosine similarity (or maximum distance) to consider a result "relevant". If a query’s top match has only 0.5 similarity (on a 0–1 scale), it might be only tangentially related. You might choose to only surface matches above, say, 0.8 similarity as suggestions to avoid false positives. This threshold can be dynamic – e.g., if nothing is above 0.8, but there are results in 0.7 range that have the same pattern_name, maybe it’s worth showing a generic suggestion about that pattern.
Diversity and pattern grouping: If the top 3 results are all instances of the same pattern (say, three occurrences of “Magic Number” across the codebase), it’s more useful to present it as one suggestion: “There are multiple instances of Magic Number (unnamed constants) similar to what you wrote.” Grouping by pattern_name and choosing the best example (or combining examples) will reduce duplicate info. Conversely, if results cover different patterns, then you want to show the distinct ones (e.g. one result suggests a security issue, another a performance issue).
Contextual ranking: Leverage metadata like severity or layer to rank what’s most important for the user. For example, if a “critical” security pattern matches moderately and a “minor” style issue matches slightly better, you might still prioritize showing the security warning. This can be achieved by a simple weighting scheme (e.g. multiply similarity by a factor based on severity) or by filtering out minor ones unless they have very high similarity.
Real-time context integration: If the IDE knows the user's current code context (like the function they are editing), the plugin could embed that and use it as part of the query. For instance, as the developer writes a function, the plugin could behind the scenes call /search_vectors with the partial function as the query to find similar past code or anti-patterns. This proactive search can drive on-the-fly hints (“Heads up: this code is starting to resemble [Pattern X]”). Just ensure the plugin throttles these calls (perhaps on file save or after significant pauses) to avoid spamming the API.
By designing the system in this way, the vector database becomes an assistive knowledge base in the IDE. It’s lightweight – using IDs and short descriptions rather than flooding the editor with large examples – but powerful enough to guide the LLM. This design is similar to how Sourcegraph’s Cody initially integrated embeddings: the embeddings help retrieve the most relevant code snippets given a query
sourcegraph.com
sourcegraph.com
, which are then provided as context. In our case, those “snippets” are annotated patterns that provide even more semantic signal than arbitrary code would. Prompt Engineering for Pattern Suggestions: When feeding the retrieved info into an LLM (like for an “explain my code” or “suggest improvements” query), consider using a prefix in the system or user prompt that frames these patterns. For example: “The following are known patterns related to the code:\n1. [Pattern Name]: [Description].\nThe assistant should use these to inform its answer.” This explicitly tells the LLM what the patterns mean, reducing chances of misunderstanding. Keep each description short (one sentence each) to minimize tokens. If needed, you can truncate or simplify pattern descriptions for the prompt. Additionally, you could attach an instruction like: “If any of the above patterns are relevant to the user’s query or code, please mention them in your answer.” – this nudges the LLM to utilize the provided context effectively, ensuring the vector retrieval actually impacts the final suggestion.
5. Feedback & Observability
Usage Instrumentation: Treat the vector search and pattern suggestion features as you would any service feature – log and measure them. Since Supabase is built on Postgres, one straightforward method is to create a table (say pattern_query_log) to record searches:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE pattern_query_log (
  timestamp timestamptz default now(),
  query_text text,
  top_pattern_id bigint,
  results_returned int,
  user_id text
);
Each time /search_vectors is called, insert a row with the query (if not sensitive) or at least how many results, which pattern was top, and which user or session (if applicable). This allows analysis via SQL (e.g. most frequent queries, which patterns are commonly triggered). You could also log to an application logger; however, having it in the DB enables creating Supabase dashboards or using a tool like Metabase/Redash to visualize it. If you prefer external observability, integrate with Prometheus by emitting counters for each search or each pattern matched. For instance, increment a counter pattern_match_total{pattern_name="MagicNumber"} whenever that pattern is returned in results. This could be done in the FastAPI code after query execution. A Grafana dashboard can then show which patterns are getting attention. If going full SQL, you might periodically aggregate the pattern_query_log data into summary tables (like daily counts per pattern). Feedback Loop Implementation: The true value of this system will come when developers give feedback on the suggestions. Implement a POST /feedback endpoint where the IDE can send events like “user accepted suggestion for pattern X” or “user dismissed pattern Y suggestion”. Define a simple payload, e.g. { pattern_id: 42, action: "upvote" | "downvote" | "view" } and log these in a pattern_feedback table:
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE pattern_feedback (
  pattern_id bigint,
  user_id text,
  feedback varchar(10), -- 'up'/'down'/'view'
  timestamp timestamptz default now()
);
With this, you can compute a score for each pattern (e.g. upvotes minus downvotes, or a more sophisticated Wilson score). You might add a score or rating column to code_patterns and update it periodically by aggregating feedback. In the vector search query, you could then use this score to boost or filter results (for example, ignore patterns with consistently negative feedback, on the assumption they were false positives or not useful). At minimum, use feedback to prioritize improving the system: if a certain pattern is often downvoted, review it – maybe the detection criteria is too broad and flagging benign code. If another is heavily upvoted, that might indicate it’s catching real issues and you could even invest in more automation around it (like an auto-fix suggestion). Technical Debt Metrics: Since each pattern vector is tagged with a severity and possibly a category, you can treat the count of those patterns as a proxy for technical debt. Consider creating a technical debt dashboard. For example:
A time-series graph of total “critical” issues in the codebase over each month (you can compute this by joining pattern occurrences with commit dates or simply by snapshotting counts each week).
Breakdown by category: how many security-related patterns vs. performance vs. maintainability. This can highlight where the debt is accumulating.
Hotspots in the code: you could aggregate by file_path to see if certain files or modules have a high density of patterns. That might pinpoint areas of the codebase needing refactor (e.g. if one module has 5 different code smells present).
By storing commit hashes with patterns, you can even correlate with the version control history. For instance, if a new commit introduces 3 instances of “Duplicate Code” pattern, you can flag that in the PR or in retrospectives. Over time, you can show non-linear trends: maybe the overall count of patterns goes down (debt being paid off), or sometimes a big rewrite drops a lot of issues at once (which you’d see as a big dip in the graph). Real-time alerts (optional advanced idea): For critical patterns (like a potential security vulnerability), you might not want to wait for the developer to notice in IDE. You could set up a trigger or monitoring query on the database: e.g., if an insert happens for a pattern with severity='critical' (meaning the pipeline found a new serious issue), send a notification. This could be an email, Slack message, or just surfacing it in your project management tool as technical debt to address. Since Supabase can trigger functions on inserts, you could use a pg_notify or Supabase function to call a webhook when such events occur. Observability of Vector Performance: Keep an eye on query performance. Use Postgres’s EXPLAIN to ensure your index is being utilized. Tools like pg_stat_statements can help find slow queries; if vector searches become slow, you might need to adjust index parameters (e.g. increase lists or m). Log search latency in your FastAPI app to catch any slowdowns early. Also monitor OpenAI API usage – how many embeddings are generated per day (could log counts of calls, or use OpenAI’s usage API) so you can estimate cost and possibly fine-tune the approach (for example, caching embeddings for identical chunks or reusing embeddings for unchanged code between commits). In summary, the feedback and observability piece closes the loop: developers get insights from the system, and the system learns from developers. By capturing their feedback and monitoring trends, you ensure the vector database remains a helpful assistant rather than a static archive. Over time, you might even incorporate the feedback into the pattern detection logic (e.g. auto-tune thresholds or use a small fine-tuned model to predict which pattern suggestions are most relevant given context, based on historical feedback).
6. Case Studies & References
The approach of using a vector database for code patterns is cutting-edge, but there are already examples and lessons from similar endeavors:
Sourcegraph Cody (Embeddings for Code): In its early versions, Sourcegraph’s Cody assistant embedded entire repositories with OpenAI embeddings to enable semantic code search
sourcegraph.com
. They found it powerful for retrieving relevant code snippets given natural language queries, although scaling to very large codebases introduced challenges of index size and maintenance
sourcegraph.com
. Your approach of focusing on patterns (a distilled form of knowledge) rather than every line of code is more targeted and will mitigate index bloat. Sourcegraph’s blog details how they compiled prompts with retrieved context
sourcegraph.com
sourcegraph.com
, which is analogous to how we plan to feed pattern context to the IDE’s LLM.
Qodo (Generative AI for Large Codebases): The team at Qodo (formerly Codium) shared their experience applying RAG to enterprise-scale code (thousands of repos)
qodo.ai
qodo.ai
. They highlight the importance of specialized chunking – they used a CST parser to chunk code and had to adjust it to capture complete context like imports
qodo.ai
qodo.ai
. This case study reinforces our emphasis on AST-based chunking. They also mention enhancing chunks with natural language descriptions before embedding
qodo.ai
, which is something you might consider for particularly tricky code (e.g., adding a comment summarizing the code’s purpose before embedding it, so the vector captures semantic intent better).
Sweep AI’s Code Chunker: As referenced in Qodo’s blog, Sweep AI open-sourced their code chunking algorithm
qodo.ai
. This algorithm ensures cohesive chunks and was even adopted by LlamaIndex. Reviewing their open-source implementation could provide practical guidance on splitting code (they likely handle many languages and edge cases). Incorporating similar logic in ScraperSky will save time and ensure you don’t re-invent proven methods.
AI Code Smells Detection (Research): Academic and blog sources have explored ML for code smells. A recent blog post “AI-Driven Code Smell Detection” describes using code embeddings to detect bad practices and even do anomaly detection on code patterns
fullvibes.dev
fullvibes.dev
. They enumerate common smells (duplicated code, long methods, God classes, etc.)
fullvibes.dev
 and discuss how AI can catch these with more context than traditional linters
fullvibes.dev
fullvibes.dev
. Your pattern library can be informed by such catalogs – e.g. ensure you cover the classic Gang of Four anti-patterns and SOLID violations. The post also noted organizations using AI for continuous quality monitoring (analyze code at commit time)
fullvibes.dev
 and developer coaching (giving suggestions with context)
fullvibes.dev
, which is exactly what ScraperSky’s integration in the IDE aims to do.
Moderne’s Code Analysis with Embeddings: Moderne.ai (which builds automated refactoring tools) has discussed how embeddings help in code impact analysis – essentially understanding code changes and dependencies via vectors
moderne.ai
. By representing code as vectors, it’s easier to cluster related functionalities even across large codebases
moderne.ai
. This underscores that beyond finding exact pattern instances, your vector DB could later be used to cluster similar implementations (maybe finding multiple different implementations of the same concept – an opportunity to refactor to a single utility). It’s a forward-looking idea: you could use the stored embeddings to detect duplicate logic across files (a form of clone detection), which is a type of pattern (“Duplicated Code” smell). In fact, an embedding-based approach will catch duplicates even if variable names differ, etc., because it’s based on semantic similarity rather than text matching
openai.com
.
OpenAI Cookbook & Others: The OpenAI Cookbook has an example of using embeddings with Supabase for semantic text search
cookbook.openai.com
, which is analogous to what you’re doing with code. There’s also growing community knowledge (e.g. on Reddit) about best practices for code vector databases – one discussion suggests embedding each function and storing in one index (not separate index per repo) for simplicity
reddit.com
, which aligns with our plan to have a single code_patterns table with a file_path or repo field for filtering. They also emphasize using a DB that supports CRUD well because code is ever-changing
reddit.com
 – pgvector on Postgres is strong here, as you can update/delete vectors transactionally, something not all standalone vector DBs handle as smoothly.
Finally, it’s worth acknowledging that this is a nascent field. Continuously update your approach as new tools emerge (for instance, vector compression techniques, new open-source embedding models specialized for code like CodeTransformer, or improved pgvector versions). The design we’ve outlined is rooted in current best practices and literature, emphasizing compatibility with OpenAI’s ecosystem and Supabase. By implementing this, you’ll not only tackle the immediate goal of pattern-based search and suggestions, but also set up an infrastructure that can grow – for example, tomorrow you might plug in a GPT-4 model that takes these pattern vectors and automatically suggests code fixes. The groundwork in data and integration you lay now will make such enhancements much easier.

In the diagram: the Ingestion Pipeline scans the code repo, detects patterns, chunks code and calls OpenAI to embed them. Vectors with metadata land in the code_patterns pgvector table. The FastAPI Service provides endpoints: IDE plugins call /search_vectors to query the table (via pgvector ANN search) and get pattern matches, then call /get_pattern for details. The IDE’s LLM (within tools like Cursor) uses that info for code suggestions. Developers give feedback (like/dislike) which is sent back to the service (/feedback), recorded in the database, and used to improve results. Meanwhile, CI/CD integration triggers the pipeline on new commits, ensuring fresh data. Monitoring components log usage and provide dashboards/alerts (e.g. if a new critical pattern appears or to track technical debt trends).
