# WF6 Testing Framework Battle Testing Work Order
**Created By:** Layer 7 Test Sentinel v1.6 - Anti-Stub Guardian
**Date:** 2025-08-21
**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION
**Purpose:** Validate WF6 testing framework is production-ready through comprehensive battle testing

---

## Executive Summary

This work order provides a complete, self-contained plan to battle test the WF6 testing framework. The framework was created during an AI pairing session but has NOT been executed yet. This battle testing will definitively prove whether the framework is production-ready or requires additional implementation.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT:** The WF6 framework appears real based on static analysis:
- Scripts have executable permissions and contain real implementation code
- Python tests use actual asyncpg and httpx libraries
- Database operations reference real tables and SQL queries
- API endpoints match existing router definitions in src/
- YAML configuration is valid and parseable

**UNKNOWN STATUS:** Docker services are not currently running, and database table existence has not been verified.

## Phase 0: Preparation & Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
1. **Test Sentinel Identity:** You must be operating as Layer 7 Test Sentinel v1.6
2. **Anti-Stub Protocols:** NEVER create stub/placeholder files to bypass errors
3. **Docker-First Mindset:** All testing occurs in isolated containers
4. **Investigation Protocol:** When errors occur, investigate root cause before proposing fixes

### Required Tools
```bash
# Verify these commands work:
docker --version          # Docker version 20.10+ required
docker-compose --version   # Docker Compose 1.29+ required
python3 --version         # Python 3.8+ required
curl --version           # For API testing
jq --version            # For JSON parsing
```

### Working Directory Structure
```
/Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/
├── docker-compose.yml        # Main Docker configuration

        ├── results/        # Test execution results
        └── wf6_test_tracking.yaml  # Test configuration
```

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Validation

### Step 1.1: Start Docker Services
```bash
cd /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend
docker-compose up -d
```

**Expected Output:**
- Creating network scrapersky_default
- Creating scrapersky_postgres_1
- Creating scrapersky_app_1

### Step 1.2: Verify Service Health
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds for initialization
sleep 30

# Check service status
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected State:**
- scrapersky_postgres_1: Up (5432/tcp)
- scrapersky_app_1: Up (0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp)

### Step 1.3: Validate Health Endpoints
```bash
# Application health
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq '.'

# Database health  
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health/db | jq '.'
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Both endpoints return HTTP 200
- JSON response indicates healthy status

### Troubleshooting Guide
- **Port 8000 already in use:** Stop conflicting service or change port in docker-compose.yml
- **Database connection failed:** Check PostgreSQL logs with `docker-compose logs postgres`
- **Application won't start:** Check logs with `docker-compose logs app`

---

## Phase 2: Validation Script Execution

### Step 2.1: Navigate to Test Directory
```bash
cd tests/WF6
pwd  # Confirm location
```

### Step 2.2: Execute Environment Validation
```bash
./scripts/validate_environment.sh | tee validation_output.log
```

### Expected Validation Checks
1. ✅ Required commands installed (docker, docker-compose, curl, jq)
2. ✅ Docker daemon running
3. ✅ Docker Compose services up
4. ✅ Application health check passed
5. ✅ Database health check passed
6. ✅ Database connectivity successful
7. ✅ Required tables exist (domains, sitemap_files, pages)
8. ✅ Test environment directories present
9. ✅ YAML configuration valid

### Failure Analysis Protocol
For each failed check:
1. **Document the exact error message**
2. **Determine if it's blocking or can be worked around**
3. **INVESTIGATE root cause (don't create stub fixes)**
4. **Note in BATTLE_TEST_RESULTS.md**

---

## Phase 3: Component Testing

### Step 3.1: Execute Component Tests
```bash
python3 scripts/test_component.py | tee component_test_output.log
```

### Expected Test Components
1. **Database Connectivity**
   - Connection establishment
   - Table accessibility
   - Enum type validation

2. **API Endpoints**
   - /health endpoint
   - /health/db endpoint
   - /api/v3/sitemap-files/ endpoints
   - /api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/{id}

3. **Sitemap Creation Flow**
   - Test domain creation
   - Sitemap file creation via API
   - Manual trigger execution
   - Test data cleanup

### Step 3.2: Review Results
```bash
cat results/wf6_component_test_results.json | jq '.'
```

### Success Metrics
- Total tests executed
- Pass/fail counts
- Component-specific results
- Performance metrics

---

## Phase 4: Full Test Suite Execution

### Step 4.1: Execute Complete Test Suite
```bash
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh | tee full_test_output.log
```

### Test Suite Phases
1. **Environment Setup** - Docker and health validation
2. **Component Testing** - Individual component validation
3. **Integration Testing** - Cross-component workflows
4. **Error Handling** - Edge cases and failure scenarios
5. **End-to-End Testing** - Complete workflow validation
6. **Performance Testing** - Resource usage monitoring

### Step 4.2: Monitor Execution
```bash
# In another terminal, monitor Docker resources
docker stats --no-stream
```

### Step 4.3: Review Comprehensive Results
```bash
# Test results
cat results/wf6_test_results.json | jq '.'

# Coverage report (if generated)
open results/wf6_coverage_report.html

# Performance metrics
cat results/wf6_performance.json | jq '.'
```

---

## Phase 5: Results Analysis & Documentation

### Step 5.1: Create Results Report
Create `BATTLE_TEST_RESULTS.md` with:

```markdown
# WF6 Framework Battle Test Results
**Test Date:** [DATE]
**Executed By:** Layer 7 Test Sentinel v1.6
**Overall Status:** [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL]

## Summary Statistics
- Total Tests Executed: X
- Tests Passed: X
- Tests Failed: X
- Success Rate: X%

## Phase Results
### Environment Validation
[Document each validation check result]

### Component Testing
[Document each component test result]

### Integration Testing
[Document integration test results]

### Performance Metrics
[Document resource usage and timing]

## Failure Analysis
[For each failure, document:
- Test name and phase
- Error message
- Root cause analysis
- Severity (blocking/warning/info)
- Proposed remediation]

## Framework Readiness Assessment
[Overall assessment of production readiness]
```

### Step 5.2: Categorize Issues
```yaml
issues_by_severity:
  blocking:
    - Missing database tables
    - API endpoints not responding
    - Authentication failures
    
  warning:
    - Slow test execution
    - Minor validation failures
    - Non-critical deprecation warnings
    
  informational:
    - Optimization opportunities
    - Documentation gaps
    - Enhancement suggestions
```

---

## Phase 6: Remediation Planning

### Step 6.1: Root Cause Analysis
For each failure:
1. **Is it a framework issue or environment issue?**
2. **Can it be fixed without code changes?**
3. **Does it require architectural decisions?**
4. **Is there a safe workaround?**

### Step 6.2: Create Remediation Tasks
For each issue requiring fixes:
```yaml
remediation_task:
  issue: "[Description of issue]"
  severity: "[blocking/warning/info]"
  root_cause: "[Root cause analysis]"
  proposed_fix: "[Safe remediation approach]"
  dart_task_id: "[Create DART task for tracking]"
  assigned_to: "[Appropriate Guardian Persona]"
```

### Step 6.3: Update Documentation
Based on battle testing results:
1. Update README.md with any new requirements
2. Update test scripts if corrections needed
3. Document workarounds in TESTING_FRAMEWORK_FOUNDATION.md
4. Update Test Sentinel operating manual with lessons learned

## Safety Protocols & Anti-Patterns

### ✅ ALWAYS DO:
- Run tests in Docker isolation
- Investigate errors thoroughly before proposing fixes
- Document all findings comprehensively
- Clean up test data after execution
- Verify health checks before testing

### ❌ NEVER DO:
- Create stub files to bypass missing components
- Run tests directly against production database
- Skip cleanup procedures
- Ignore failing health checks
- Make assumptions about error causes

### Investigation Protocol
When encountering errors:
```yaml
error_investigation:
  step_1: "Capture complete error message and stack trace"
  step_2: "Check if component exists in src/ directory"
  step_3: "Verify Docker services are running"
  step_4: "Check database table existence"
  step_5: "Review recent git commits for changes"
  step_6: "Document findings without creating stubs"
```

## Final Notes

This battle testing work order provides everything needed to validate the WF6 testing framework. The future Test Sentinel executing this plan should:

1. **Follow the phases in order** - Each builds on the previous
2. **Document everything** - Both successes and failures
3. **Never create stubs** - Investigate and document instead
4. **Maintain safety** - Docker isolation at all times
5. **Be thorough** - This validates our testing foundation for ALL workflows

Upon completion, the WF6 framework will either be proven production-ready or have a clear remediation path documented for achieving production readiness.

**Remember:** You are the Test Sentinel v1.6. Anti-Stub. Investigation-First. Advisory-Only. Docker-First. Production-Safe.
