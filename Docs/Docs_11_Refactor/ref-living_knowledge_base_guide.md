# Living Knowledge Base Management Guide

## THE HYBRID APPROACH

This guide establishes how to build and maintain a **living knowledge base** that combines:
- **DART MCP infrastructure** (tasks, tags, notes, relationships)
- **Pattern documentation** (reusable fix templates)
- **Continuous learning** (tips, tricks, edge cases, insights)
- **Architectural wisdom** (why certain approaches work better)

## KNOWLEDGE BASE ARCHITECTURE

### Primary Storage: DART Tasks + Notes System
```
DART INFRASTRUCTURE USAGE:
├── Tasks (individual fixes with context)
├── Tags (categorization and filtering)
├── Notes (pattern documentation and insights)
├── Relationships (dependencies and similarities)
└── Comments (real-time learning capture)
```

### Knowledge Categories

#### 1. FIX PATTERNS (Reusable Solutions)
**Location**: DART task notes + tags
**Structure**:
```
Tag: FixPattern-[PatternName]
Note Title: PATTERN: [Descriptive Name]
Content:
- Problem Type: [Security/Architecture/Standards/UI-UX]
- Applies To: [File types, layers, workflows]
- Solution Template: [Step-by-step approach]
- Code Examples: [Before/after snippets]
- Verification: [How to confirm success]
- Time Estimate: [Typical duration]
- Success Rate: [How often this works]
- Edge Cases: [Special considerations]
- Related Patterns: [Links to similar approaches]
```

#### 2. LEARNING INSIGHTS (Accumulated Wisdom)
**Location**: DART task comments + dedicated insight notes
**Structure**:
```
Tag: Insight-[Category]
Examples:
- Insight-TenantIDRemoval: "Always check for hardcoded UUIDs in comments"
- Insight-ServiceCreation: "Copy page_curation_service.py as template"
- Insight-EnumStandardization: "Check both Python and DB enum names"
- Insight-UIDataRefresh: "fetchData() must be called in success callback"
```

#### 3. ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (Why Things Work)
**Location**: DART notes with architectural context
**Structure**:
```
Tag: Architecture-[Principle]
Note Title: ARCH: [Principle Name]
Content:
- Context: [When this applies]
- Principle: [The rule or guideline]
- Rationale: [Why this approach is preferred]
- Examples: [Real implementations]
- Anti-patterns: [What NOT to do]
- Exceptions: [Rare cases where rule doesn't apply]
```

#### 4. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDES (When Things Go Wrong)
**Location**: DART task comments + troubleshooting notes
**Structure**:
```
Tag: Troubleshoot-[ProblemType]
Note Title: TROUBLESHOOT: [Problem Description]
Content:
- Symptoms: [How to recognize this problem]
- Common Causes: [What usually triggers this]
- Diagnostic Steps: [How to investigate]
- Solutions: [Ranked by likelihood of success]
- Prevention: [How to avoid in future]
```

## CONTINUOUS LEARNING PROTOCOL

### During Each Fix Session
**Real-time knowledge capture**:

#### 1. Pre-Fix Learning
```
Before starting any task:
1. Query DART: "Show me patterns tagged with [current issue type]"
2. Review related patterns and insights
3. Check for architectural guidance
4. Look for troubleshooting notes if similar issues failed before
```

#### 2. During-Fix Learning
```
While implementing:
1. Add task comments for any unexpected discoveries
2. Note deviations from documented patterns
3. Record time spent vs. estimates
4. Document any code or tools that were particularly helpful
```

#### 3. Post-Fix Learning
```
After completing task:
1. Update pattern documentation with new insights
2. Add task relationship links to similar issues
3. Create new insights if significant learning occurred
4. Update time estimates based on actual experience
5. Tag task with all relevant metadata
```

### Pattern Evolution Protocol
**How patterns get better over time**:

#### Pattern Maturity Levels
```
Level 1: EXPERIMENTAL (first attempt at this fix type)
- Document basic approach
- Note what worked/didn't work
- Flag for refinement

Level 2: TESTED (applied 2-3 times successfully)  
- Refine steps based on multiple applications
- Add edge cases discovered
- Improve time estimates

Level 3: PROVEN (applied 5+ times with high success rate)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear verification steps
- Well-understood limitations
- Teaching-quality examples

Level 4: MASTERED (automatable/templateable)
- Optimized for maximum efficiency
- Handles all known edge cases
- Can be executed by following template exactly
- Serves as training material for similar patterns
```

### Knowledge Base Queries
**How to find what you need**:

#### By Problem Type
```
"Show me all tasks tagged with Security and status:Done"
"Find patterns for Architecture problems in Layer 4"
"Get troubleshooting guides for UI refresh issues"
```

#### By Success Rate
```
"Show me most successful patterns (applied 3+ times)"
"Find patterns that needed refinement"
"List experimental approaches that worked"
```

#### By Efficiency
```
"Show patterns ranked by time-to-completion"
"Find quick wins (sub-15 minute fixes)"
"List complex patterns that need optimization"
```

## KNOWLEDGE BASE MAINTENANCE

### Weekly Reviews
**Keep the knowledge base healthy**:

#### Pattern Health Check
```
Every 10-15 completed tasks:
1. Review patterns used multiple times - can they be optimized?
2. Identify patterns that failed - need troubleshooting guides?
3. Look for emerging patterns - should new templates be created?
4. Update success rates and time estimates based on recent data
```

#### Knowledge Organization
```
Monthly maintenance:
1. Consolidate similar patterns that could be merged
2. Archive outdated approaches that are no longer needed
3. Promote experimental patterns that have proven successful
4. Create training sequences for complex multi-step fixes
```

### Knowledge Sharing Protocol
**How insights spread across sessions**:

#### Session Handoff
```
At end of each work session:
1. Update DART with session summary note
2. Tag key insights discovered
3. Flag any patterns that need refinement
4. Identify next logical tasks based on patterns
```

#### Cross-Session Learning
```
At start of new session:
1. Review recent insights and pattern updates
2. Check for pattern refinements since last session
3. Look for new troubleshooting guides
4. Update understanding based on accumulated knowledge
```

## ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE FEATURES

### Pattern Relationships
**How fixes connect to each other**:
```
DEPENDENCY PATTERNS:
- "Must fix BaseModel inheritance before enum standardization"
- "Service creation enables router logic cleanup"
- "Auth fixes must precede UI functional testing"

SIMILARITY PATTERNS:
- "JWT removal follows same steps across all UI files"
- "Service creation template works for all missing workflows"
- "Enum fixes apply same regex patterns"

CONFLICT PATTERNS:
- "Don't attempt tenant removal while auth refactoring active"
- "UI changes may break if backend routes change simultaneously"
```

### Predictive Insights
**Knowledge base helps predict future issues**:
```
PATTERN-BASED PREDICTIONS:
- "If fixing enum naming in Layer 1, expect to need DB migration"
- "Service creation often reveals missing scheduler files"
- "Auth fixes frequently expose additional missing permissions"

VELOCITY PREDICTIONS:
- "Based on similar patterns, this should take 15-20 minutes"
- "Complex service creation typically needs 45 minutes first time"
- "UI refresh fixes average 10 minutes after pattern established"
```

### Success Optimization
**Knowledge base drives continuous improvement**:
```
EFFICIENCY TRACKING:
- Which patterns have shortest implementation time?
- What verification steps catch the most issues?
- Which architectural approaches have highest success rates?

QUALITY METRICS:
- How often do pattern-based fixes work on first try?
- What percentage of fixes require follow-up tasks?
- Which knowledge base queries save the most time?
```
