# Layer 3 Fix Pattern: Places Staging Error Handling and Type Correction

## Pattern Details

*   **Title:** Places Staging Error Handling and Type Correction
*   **Problem Type:** bugfix, standards
*   **Code Type:** router, error-handling, type-checking
*   **Severity:** MEDIUM-BUGFIX, MEDIUM-STANDARDS
*   **Tags:** ["error-handling", "places-staging", "linter-fix", "type-errors", "sqlalchemy-orm", "layer-3"]
*   **Layers:** [3]
*   **Workflows:** ["WF2"]
*   **File Types:** ["py"]
*   **Problem Description:** The `update_places_status_batch` endpoint in `src/routers/places_staging.py` had a `ruff F841` linter error (`error_message` assigned but unused) and Pylance type errors related to SQLAlchemy ORM `Column` assignments (`deep_scan_status`, `deep_scan_error`, `updated_at`) and incorrect enum member access. The `error_message` field, intended to capture error details, was not being utilized.
*   **Solution Steps:**
    1.  Added an `elif` condition within the `for place in places_to_process:` loop to check if `error_message is not None`.
    2.  Explicitly set `place.deep_scan_status` to `GcpApiDeepScanStatusEnum.Error.value` when an `error_message` is present, ensuring the correct string value is assigned.
    3.  Assigned the `error_message` to `place.deep_scan_error`.
    4.  Updated `place.updated_at` timestamp in this error handling branch.
    5.  Added `# type: ignore` comments to suppress Pylance warnings on SQLAlchemy ORM attribute assignments where runtime behavior is correct.
*   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Confirmed `ruff F841` linter error for `error_message` is resolved.
    2.  Verified Pylance type errors related to the new logic are suppressed or resolved.
    3.  Ensured the `update_places_status_batch` function correctly processes and stores error messages associated with place status updates.
*   **Learnings:**
    1.  Always ensure all input parameters are utilized in the logic, or explicitly handled if not needed, to avoid linter warnings.
    2.  When assigning values to SQLAlchemy ORM `Column` attributes, especially from Enums, ensure the `.value` is used to assign the underlying string, and be prepared to use `# type: ignore` for Pylance's strictness where appropriate.
    3.  Robust error handling and clear status propagation are crucial for data integrity and debugging in asynchronous workflows.
*   **Prevention Guidance:**
    1.  Implement explicit error handling branches for all possible error states in batch processing functions.
    2.  Always use `.value` when assigning Enum members to database columns.
    3.  Regularly run linters and type checkers, and address warnings/errors systematically.
