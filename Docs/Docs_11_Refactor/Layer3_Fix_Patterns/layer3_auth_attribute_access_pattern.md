# Layer 3 Fix Pattern: Authentication and Attribute Access Correction

## Pattern Details

*   **Title:** Authentication and Attribute Access Correction Pattern
*   **Problem Type:** security
*   **Code Type:** router
*   **Severity:** CRITICAL-SECURITY
*   **Tags:** ["Engineering", "L3", "MissingAuth", "Security", "WF7", "authentication", "attribute-access"]
*   **Layers:** [3]
*   **Workflows:** ["WF7"]
*   **File Types:** ["py"]
*   **Problem Description:** Missing authentication on endpoints and/or incorrect attribute access when handling user data (e.g., from JWT tokens) in routers.
*   **Solution Steps:**
    1.  Add the standard authentication dependency (`Depends(get_current_active_user)`) to affected endpoint function signatures.
    2.  Ensure user data returned by the dependency is accessed using the correct method (e.g., dictionary key access `current_user['id']` for JWT payload dictionaries).
    3.  Verify and correct import statements for authentication dependencies and type hints.
    4.  Add or correct type hints for the user object in endpoint signatures (e.g., `Dict[str, Any]`).
*   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  Confirm all affected endpoints now have the authentication dependency.
    2.  Verify user ID or other user data is correctly accessed within the endpoint logic.
    3.  Test the endpoint with a valid JWT token to ensure successful execution.
    4.  Test the endpoint without a token or with an invalid token to ensure requests are correctly rejected (e.g., returning 401 Unauthorized).
*   **Learnings:**
    1.  Import Verification: Always verify that imported names are actually defined and exported by the source module.
    2.  Attribute Access Consistency: Use appropriate access patterns based on object type (dot notation for objects, key access for dictionaries).
    3.  Authentication Requirements: All API endpoints must include authentication dependencies, especially those performing sensitive operations.
    4.  Type Hints: Ensure type hints accurately reflect the actual types returned by dependencies.
*   **Prevention Guidance:** Always add authentication to all new endpoints by default. Use dictionary access for JWT user data payloads.
*   **Created By:** Architect Persona (Documented by Roo)
*   **Reviewed:** false (Needs formal review)
*   **Description:** Pattern for fixing common authentication issues and attribute access errors in API routers, particularly when accessing user data from JWT tokens after applying an authentication dependency.
