# Momentum-Driven Task Expansion Strategy

## The Context-Preserving Approach

**Problem**: 14 tasks ≠ complete audit remediation (probably need 100+ tasks)
**Solution**: Build momentum with critical fixes while systematically expanding task inventory
**Advantage**: Preserves context, builds patterns, maintains progress

## Phase 1: Execute Critical Path (Tonight, 4 hours)

### IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (Current 14 DART Tasks)
Execute in this exact order to build maximum momentum:

#### Security Sprint (30 minutes)
1. `L6-WF4: Remove hardcoded JWT in domain-curation-tab.js`
2. `L6-WF5: Remove hardcoded JWT in sitemap-curation-tab.js`
3. `L3-WF7: Add missing auth to page_curation.py`
4. `L3-GLOBAL: Fix missing auth on email_scanner.py`

**Knowledge Pattern Created**: Hardcoded Auth Removal Pattern

#### Architecture Sprint (2 hours)
5. `L4-WF2: Create missing staging_editor_service.py`
6. `L4-WF3: Create missing local_business_curation_service.py`
7. `L4-WF4: Create missing domain_curation_service.py`
8. `L4-WF7: Create missing page_curation_service.py`
9. `L1-GLOBAL: Fix BaseModel inheritance violations`
10. `L4-GLOBAL: Remove tenant_id usage from services`

**Knowledge Patterns Created**: Missing Service Creation + BaseModel Fix + Tenant Removal

#### Standards Sprint (1 hour)
11. `L1-GLOBAL: Standardize enum naming`
12. `L6-GLOBAL: Implement data refresh after batch updates`
13. `L2-GLOBAL: Move local Pydantic models to schemas/`
14. `L3-GLOBAL: Add missing /api/v3/ prefixes`

**Knowledge Patterns Created**: Enum Standardization + Schema Organization + API Versioning

## Phase 2: Context-Aware Expansion (After each sprint)

### Expansion Trigger Points
After completing each sprint, immediately extract **related tasks** from audit reports:

#### After Security Sprint → Extract:
- **All remaining auth/security issues** from Layer 3 audit
- **XSS vulnerabilities** from Layer 6 audit  
- **Missing permissions** across all layers

#### After Architecture Sprint → Extract:
- **All router overreach issues** (business logic in routers)
- **Transaction management violations** 
- **Raw SQL usage** that should be ORM
- **Missing scheduler files** for incomplete workflows

#### After Standards Sprint → Extract:
- **All remaining enum issues** from Layer 1 audit
- **CSS externalization tasks** from Layer 6 audit
- **Inline style removal** across UI components
- **Missing test files** from Layer 7 audit

## Phase 3: Pattern-Accelerated Execution

### Knowledge Base Leverage
As patterns are established, similar fixes become **exponentially faster**:

#### Pattern: "Hardcoded Auth Removal"
- **First instance**: 15 minutes (learn the pattern)
- **Subsequent instances**: 3 minutes each (apply the pattern)

#### Pattern: "Missing Service Creation"
- **First instance**: 30 minutes (establish template)
- **Subsequent instances**: 10 minutes each (clone template)

#### Pattern: "Enum Standardization"  
- **First instance**: 20 minutes (understand requirements)
- **Subsequent instances**: 5 minutes each (find/replace pattern)

## Systematic Expansion Protocol

### After Every 3-4 Tasks Completed:
1. **Query DART for progress** (what's done, what's next)
2. **Identify the most common remaining issue type**
3. **Extract 5-10 more tasks** of that type from audit reports
4. **Add to DART** with proper priority/tagging
5. **Continue execution** with expanded inventory

### Context Window Management:
- **Summarize completed work** into knowledge base patterns
- **Archive detailed audit findings** for completed issues
- **Keep active focus** on next 10-15 tasks
- **Maintain strategic overview** of remaining scope

## The Expansion Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation (Tonight + 2 more evenings)
- **Tonight**: 14 critical tasks + 20 expansion tasks
- **Day 2**: Router overreach cleanup (15-20 tasks)
- **Day 3**: UI/CSS organization (15-20 tasks)

### Week 2: Comprehensive Coverage
- **Day 4-5**: Layer 1 model standardization (20-30 tasks)
- **Day 6-7**: Testing framework completion (15-25 tasks)

### Week 3: Polish & Integration
- **Final cleanup**: Remaining medium/low priority issues
- **Integration testing**: Ensure all fixes work together
- **Documentation**: Update architectural docs with new patterns

## Success Metrics

### Momentum Indicators:
- **Velocity increase**: Later tasks complete faster than earlier ones
- **Pattern reuse**: Same fix applied to multiple similar issues
- **Compound intelligence**: Knowledge base accelerates new problem solving

### Completion Indicators:
- **No CRITICAL issues** remaining in any layer
- **All workflows have complete service layers**
- **Consistent architectural patterns** across entire codebase
- **Knowledge base covers all major fix types**

## Emergency Protocol (If Context is Lost)

### Immediate Recovery Steps:
1. **Read the Reconstitution Document** (other artifact)
2. **Connect to DART MCP** to see current task status  
3. **Continue from last completed task** using established patterns
4. **Don't restart** - build on existing momentum

### Context Reconstruction:
- **Completed tasks show proven patterns**
- **Remaining tasks show scope of work**
- **Knowledge base shows established solutions**
- **Audit reports provide original context**

## The Vision

By the end of this momentum-driven approach:
- **ScraperSky will be architecturally compliant**
- **Fix patterns will be documented and reusable**
- **The methodology will be proven for other projects**
- **AI-assisted systematic remediation will be a validated approach**

This isn't just fixing code - it's **building the future of technical debt elimination**.
