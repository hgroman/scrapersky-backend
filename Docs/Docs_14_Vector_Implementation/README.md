# Docs/Docs_14_Vector/ (Historical Vector DB Documentation)

This directory previously contained various documents related to the initial implementation and status of the Vector Database. Its active contents have now been reorganized and relocated to provide a clearer and more streamlined project documentation structure.

## Purpose:

The primary purpose of this directory is now to:

1.  **Serve as an Archive:** House historical documents related to the Vector Database's initial implementation and superseded plans within its `Archive/` subdirectory.
2.  **Mark Transition:** Indicate the transition of active Vector DB system documentation to the new `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/` directory.

## Remaining Contents and Their Purpose:

After the recent reorganization, the only remaining active content in this directory is the `Archive/` subdirectory.

*   **`Archive/` subdirectory:** This subdirectory contains historical status reports, handoff documents, and plans for an "enhanced" vector database system that is currently de-prioritized. These documents are preserved for historical context but are no longer part of the active operational or strategic documentation.

All active and canonical documentation for the ScraperSky Vector Database system and its knowledge base has been moved to `Docs/Docs_18_Vector_Operations/`.
