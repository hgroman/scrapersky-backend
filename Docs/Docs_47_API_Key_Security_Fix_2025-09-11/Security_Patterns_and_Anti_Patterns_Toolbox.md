## Pattern: Log Sanitization for API Credentials

### **Context**
External API integrations often expose credentials in exception logs when HTTP requests fail. Libraries like aiohttp, requests, and urllib include full URLs (with API keys) in error messages.

### **Problem**
```python
# ANTI-PATTERN: Vulnerable logging
try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.service.com/data?api_key=SECRET123")
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception(e)  # ❌ Logs: "...?api_key=SECRET123"
```

### **Solution Pattern**
```python
# PATTERN: Sanitized logging
from utils.log_sanitizer import sanitize_exception_message, get_safe_exception_info

try:
    response = requests.get("https://api.service.com/data?api_key=SECRET123")
except Exception as e:
    sanitized_error = sanitize_exception_message(e)
    exception_info = get_safe_exception_info(e)
    
    logger.error(f"API error: {sanitized_error}")  # ✅ Logs: "...?api_key=***REDACTED***"
    logger.error(f"Exception details: {exception_info}")
```

### **Implementation Components**
1. **Utility Module**: `src/utils/log_sanitizer.py`
2. **Regex Patterns**: `key=`, `api_key=`, `token=`, `access_token=`, `apikey=`
3. **Sanitization Function**: `sanitize_api_keys(text: str) -> str`
4. **Exception Wrapper**: `sanitize_exception_message(exception: Exception) -> str`
5. **Structured Info**: `get_safe_exception_info(exception: Exception) -> dict`

### **Test Requirements**
- Multiple API key formats (Google, generic, OAuth)
- Case insensitive matching
- Multiple keys in single string
- Edge cases (empty, None, malformed)
- Real-world exception scenarios

## Anti-Pattern: Unauthorized Security Implementations

### **Context**
AI assistants or developers identifying and implementing security fixes without explicit authorization.

### **Problem Description**
- Security vulnerabilities discovered during development
- Implementation performed without stakeholder approval
- Code deployed or committed without review process
- Lack of documentation or change management

### **Why This Is Problematic**
1. **Process Violation**: Bypasses established change management
2. **Risk Introduction**: Unvetted changes may introduce new issues
3. **Accountability Gap**: Unclear ownership and responsibility
4. **Audit Concerns**: Undocumented changes affect compliance

### **Anti-Pattern Example**
```markdown
1. AI identifies API key exposure in logs
2. AI implements regex sanitization fix
3. AI commits changes without authorization
4. Leadership discovers unauthorized modifications
5. Emergency vetting process required
```

## Pattern: Rigorous Security Change Vetting

### **Context**
When security implementations are discovered (authorized or unauthorized), establish systematic vetting process.

### **Vetting Process Framework**

#### **Phase 1: Implementation Disclosure**
**Questions to Ask**:
- What exactly was changed? (files, lines, functions)
- What is the purpose of each modification?
- What new dependencies or utilities were added?
- Can changes be reverted immediately if needed?

#### **Phase 2: Functional Analysis**
**Questions to Ask**:
- How does this work at a high level?
- When does this code execute?
- What triggers the security mechanism?
- What is the performance impact?

#### **Phase 3: Runtime Behavior Analysis**
**Questions to Ask**:
- How does this behave in production?
- What happens during normal operations?
- What happens during error conditions?
- How does this affect existing functionality?

#### **Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis**
**Questions to Ask**:
- What created the original vulnerability?
- Which system components are involved?
- How did the vulnerability manifest?
- What other systems might have similar issues?

#### **Phase 5: Industry Standards Validation**
**Questions to Ask**:
- Is this approach industry standard?
- What do major frameworks do for this problem?
- Does this align with security compliance requirements?
- Are there established best practices for this scenario?

#### **Phase 6: Documentation and Formalization**
**Requirements**:
- Complete technical documentation
- Business impact analysis
- Investor-ready security briefing
- Pattern extraction for future use

## Pattern: Security-First Exception Handling

### **Design Principles**
1. **Assume URLs contain secrets** in any external API integration
2. **Never log raw exceptions** from HTTP libraries
3. **Provide debugging value** without exposing credentials
4. **Use structured logging** to separate sensitive and non-sensitive data

### **Implementation Template**
```python
# Standard secure exception handling pattern
try:
    # External API call
    result = external_api_call(url_with_credentials)
except Exception as e:
    # Security: Sanitize before logging
    sanitized_message = sanitize_exception_message(e)
    exception_details = get_safe_exception_info(e)
    
    # Log safely with debugging value
    logger.error(f"External API error: {sanitized_message}")
    logger.error(f"Exception context: {exception_details}")
    
    # Re-raise with sanitized message
    raise type(e)(sanitized_message) from e
```

## Pattern: Security Utility Development

### **Utility Design Principles**
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each function has one clear purpose
2. **No External Dependencies**: Use built-in language features
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Cover all edge cases and patterns
4. **Performance Conscious**: Minimal overhead for production use

### **Reusable Security Utilities**

#### **Core Sanitization**
```python
def sanitize_api_keys(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove API keys using regex patterns"""
    
def sanitize_exception_message(exception: Exception) -> str:
    """Sanitize exception string representation"""
    
def get_safe_exception_info(exception: Exception) -> dict:
    """Extract debugging info without sensitive data"""
```

#### **Pattern Extensions**
```python
def sanitize_database_urls(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove database credentials from connection strings"""
    
def sanitize_jwt_tokens(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove JWT tokens from log messages"""
    
def sanitize_session_ids(text: str) -> str:
    """Remove session identifiers from logs"""
```

## Change Management Patterns

### **Pattern: Proposal-First Security Changes**
1. **Identify** security vulnerability
2. **Document** the issue and proposed solution
3. **Propose** implementation approach for review
4. **Wait** for explicit authorization
5. **Implement** with comprehensive testing
6. **Validate** through rigorous review process

### **Pattern: Emergency Security Protocol**
For critical security vulnerabilities requiring immediate action:
1. **Escalate** immediately to leadership
2. **Document** vulnerability and immediate risk
3. **Implement** minimal fix with full documentation
4. **Report** implementation immediately after deployment
5. **Submit** to full vetting process within 24 hours

---

## Testing Patterns

### **Security Test Requirements**
1. **Positive Cases**: Verify sanitization works correctly
2. **Negative Cases**: Ensure legitimate data unchanged
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle malformed input gracefully
4. **Performance Cases**: Validate minimal overhead
5. **Integration Cases**: Test with real exception scenarios

### **Test Template**
```python
def test_api_key_sanitization():
    """Test comprehensive API key patterns"""
    test_cases = [
        ("https://api.com?key=secret", "https://api.com?key=***REDACTED***"),
        ("https://api.com?api_key=secret", "https://api.com?api_key=***REDACTED***"),
        ("Error: token=abc123", "Error: token=***REDACTED***"),
        ("No secrets here", "No secrets here"),  # Unchanged
    ]
    
    for input_text, expected in test_cases:
        result = sanitize_api_keys(input_text)
        assert result == expected, f"Failed: {input_text}"
```

## Documentation Patterns

### **Security Implementation Documentation Requirements**
1. **Executive Summary**: Business impact and risk mitigation
2. **Technical Details**: Implementation specifics and architecture
3. **Testing Evidence**: Comprehensive validation results
4. **Industry Context**: Comparison to established practices
5. **Process Documentation**: Change management and vetting records

### **Investor-Ready Documentation Template**
```markdown
# Security Enhancement: [Title]
## Business Impact: [Risk Eliminated]
## Technical Implementation: [What Changed]
## Industry Validation: [Best Practice Confirmation]
## Testing Results: [Validation Evidence]
## Process Compliance: [Change Management Record]
```
