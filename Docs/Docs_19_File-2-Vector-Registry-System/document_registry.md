# ScraperSky Vector Database Document Registry

**Date:** 2025-06-03  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** Active

This document serves as a local "cheat sheet" to track the status of documents intended for or currently residing in the `public.project_docs` vector database table. **This file is automatically generated by the `generate_document_registry.py` script and should not be manually edited.**

> **IMPORTANT**: Documents with the `v_` prefix are specifically marked for inclusion in the vector database. This prefix serves as a clear visual indicator of which documents are intended to be embedded in the vector database.

## Document Status Categories:

*   **In Database:** Documents successfully ingested into the `project_docs` table.
*   **In Queue:** Documents identified for ingestion but not yet processed.
*   **Not Yet Ingested:** Documents identified as authoritative but not yet in the database or queue.
