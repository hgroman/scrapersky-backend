# WORK ORDER: Diagnose and Fix Container Startup Failure

**Date:** September 13, 2025
**Priority:** Blocker

## 1. Executive Summary

The backend implementation for the new Contacts CRUD endpoint is code-complete. However, all attempts to run the application via `docker compose up` have failed. The container starts and then immediately exits.

This work order delegates the task of diagnosing and fixing this container startup failure.

## 2. Context: Completed Implementation

The following files were created or modified to implement the feature. The error is likely within one of these changes.

*   **Created:**
    *   `CONTACTS_ENDPOINT_GUIDE.md`
    *   `src/schemas/contact_schemas.py`
    *   `src/routers/v3/contacts_router.py`
    *   `migrations/20250913_add_indexes_to_contacts.sql`
*   **Modified:**
    *   `Dockerfile` (to add development dependencies)
    *   `requirements.txt` (to add and then remove `sqlalchemy-utils`)
    *   `src/main.py` (to register the new router)
    *   `src/models/WF7_V2_L1_1of1_ContactModel.py` (to add all fields and use `sqlalchemy.Enum`)

## 3. History of Failed Debugging Attempts

Multiple errors were found and fixed, but the container still fails to start. This history is provided to avoid repeating failed steps.

1.  **`SyntaxError: unmatched ')'` in `src/main.py`:** An erroneous line was found at the end of the file and removed. **(FIXED)**
2.  **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy_utils'`:** This was caused by an incorrect dependency. The fix was to remove `sqlalchemy-utils` from `requirements.txt` and modify the Contact model to use the native `sqlalchemy.Enum`. **(FIXED)**
3.  **`NameError: name 'contacts_router' is not defined` in `src/main.py`:** This was caused by a missing import statement for the new router. The import was added. **(FIXED)**
4.  **`Dockerfile` corruption:** The `Dockerfile` was corrupted multiple times by faulty `replace` commands. It has since been overwritten with a clean version that correctly copies and installs both `requirements.txt` and `requirements/dev.txt`. **(FIXED)**

After all these fixes, the container still exits on startup. The root cause is currently unknown.

## 4. Objective

Find the root cause of the container startup failure and apply a fix so that the `scrapersky` service runs successfully.

## 5. Step-by-Step Investigation Plan (How to Fish)

Follow this debugging cycle until the container runs successfully:

1.  **Confirm the Failure:** Run `docker compose up --build -d`. You should see it start and then exit.
2.  **Get the Error:** Run `docker compose logs scrapersky` to retrieve the full traceback from the container logs. This is the most critical step.
3.  **Analyze the Traceback:** Read the error message at the bottom of the traceback. It will tell you the file and line number that caused the crash, and the type of error (e.g., `ImportError`, `SyntaxError`, `NameError`).
4.  **Inspect the Code:** Use the `read_file` tool to view the file identified in the error log. Examine the line number mentioned in the error.
5.  **Formulate and Apply a Fix:** Based on the error, create a fix. Use `replace` for small changes or `write_file` for larger ones. Explain your fix clearly.
6.  **Return to Step 1:** Re-build the container and check the logs again. Repeat this loop until the error is gone.

## 6. Success Criteria

The task is complete when the following two conditions are met:

1.  Running `docker compose up --build -d` results in a running container.
2.  Running `docker compose ps` shows the `scrapersky` service with `STATUS` as `Up` or `healthy` for at least one minute.
