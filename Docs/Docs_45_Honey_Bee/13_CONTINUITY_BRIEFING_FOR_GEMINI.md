## Subject: Sitemap Processing Pipeline Debugging

This document summarizes a series of cascading failures and subsequent fixes applied to the sitemap import scheduler. The system is now believed to be stable, but this context is crucial for any future work.

### Initial State & Core Problem

The user initially reported that the sitemap processing pipeline was completely stalled. All sitemap files were stuck in the `Queued` status and were never being moved to `Processing`. This indicated a total failure of the `sitemap_import_scheduler` background job.

### The Debugging & Fixing Timeline

The root cause was a latent bug in the `run_job_loop` SDK that was triggered by a recent, seemingly harmless refactoring. This led to a series of cascading failures as each fix uncovered the next underlying issue.

**1. The Scheduler Crash (TypeError):**
*   **Cause:** A recent commit (`0611775`) had removed the `uuid.UUID` type hint from the `sitemap_file_id` parameter in the `process_single_sitemap_file` function signature.
*   **Impact:** The `run_job_loop` SDK, which calls this function, is strongly typed and expected a function matching `Callable[[UUID, AsyncSession], ...]`. The signature mismatch raised a `TypeError` that crashed the entire scheduler job on startup.
*   **Fix:** The `import uuid` and the `uuid.UUID` type hint were restored to `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`.

**2. The Race Condition (Stale Data):**
*   **Cause:** After fixing the crash, the scheduler ran, but every item was immediately skipped. The `run_job_loop` updates an item's status to `Processing` in one transaction, then calls the processing function with a *new* database session. This new session was reading a stale version of the data from before the status update was committed or visible.
*   **Impact:** A safety check inside `process_single_sitemap_file` would see the old `Queued` status (not the new `Processing` status) and skip the item.
*   **Fix:** `await session.refresh(sitemap_file)` was added at the beginning of the `process_single_sitemap_file` function to force a reload of the data from the database, ensuring the check was performed against the correct, non-stale status.

**3. The Build Failure (IndentationError):**
*   **Cause:** The previous `replace` operation that added the `session.refresh()` line introduced an indentation error.
*   **Impact:** The Python interpreter failed on startup, preventing the application from building and deploying.
*   **Fix:** The indentation in `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py` was corrected.

### Current System Status (As of last observation)

*   **CRITICAL ISSUE:** The system is in a failed state. While the scheduler now runs correctly, items are getting stuck in the `Processing` status and never completing.
*   **Evolution of the Bug:** The problem has shifted. The initial "stuck in `Queued`" issue is resolved, but now the processing function itself appears to be failing silently during execution.
*   **Code Status:** All previous fixes (UUID type hint, session refresh, indentation) have been committed and deployed.

### Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

1.  **Analyze Production Logs:** The immediate and most critical next step is to obtain and analyze the latest production logs from `render.com`. The logs must cover a time window where the `sitemap_import_scheduler` attempts to process a sitemap.
2.  **Identify Runtime Error:** Look for the specific runtime error within the logs that is causing the `process_single_sitemap_file` function to fail without being caught by the main exception handlers. This is the key to the current problem.
3.  **Verify Deployment:** Confirm that all committed code changes, especially to `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`, are correctly deployed and running in the production environment.

### Crucial Context & Where to Find Truth

*   **The Source of Truth is the sequence of fixes.** The core of the problem is the fragile, strongly-typed interface between the generic `run_job_loop` SDK and the specific services it calls. Seemingly minor changes can break the entire system.
*   **Key Code Files:**
    *   `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`: The epicenter of all recent fixes.
    *   `src/common/curation_sdk/scheduler_loop.py`: The generic scheduler whose strict requirements were the root cause of the initial failure.
    *   `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py`: The configuration for the job.
*   **Key Documents:**
    *   `Docs/Docs_42_Honey_Bee/`: This folder contains the business and technical context for the recent "Honeybee" feature development that preceded the bugs.
    *   `Docs/Docs_42_Honey_Bee/07_POSTMORTEM_SITEMAP_SCHEDULER_FIX.md`: A detailed post-mortem of the scheduler failure that was created during this session.
