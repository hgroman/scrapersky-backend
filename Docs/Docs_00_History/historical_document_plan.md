# ScraperSky Project History Document Creation Plan

## Objective

To create a concise and impactful historical narrative for new AI personas, explaining the project's evolution, challenges, and the significance of their role in maintaining architectural integrity and eliminating technical debt.

## High-Level Plan

1.  **Create High-Level Plan Document:** (This step) Outline the process and scope of the historical review.
2.  **Directory Review (Quick Dip - Phase 1):** Sequentially review the specified directories to understand their contribution to the project's history.
    *   For each directory:
        *   Perform a quick review of its contents (e.g., file names, key document titles).
        *   Identify its role in the project's historical narrative (e.g., documenting initial state, refactoring efforts, standardization, audits, persona development).
        *   Document key findings and how they fit into the overall story.
3.  **Synthesize Findings:** Combine the insights from the directory reviews to form a comprehensive understanding of the project's historical timeline and key milestones.
4.  **Delegate Deep Dive (Phase 2):** Hand off the synthesized findings and the task of distilling the final historical narrative to a delegated session for detailed analysis and writing.

## Scope of Directory Review

The following directories will be reviewed in the specified order:

*   `/Docs/Docs_0_SQL-Alchemy-Over-Engineered-Nightmare`
*   `/Docs/Docs_2_Feature-Alignment-Testing-Plan`
*   `/Docs/Docs_3_ContentMap`
