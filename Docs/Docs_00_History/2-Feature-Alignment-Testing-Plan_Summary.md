# Historical Summary: Docs/Docs_2_Feature-Alignment-Testing-Plan

This directory documents a crucial phase in the ScraperSky modernization project focused on aligning existing features with the emerging architectural standards, implementing rigorous testing, and addressing specific, high-impact technical debt areas. It signifies a shift from initial planning to the systematic application and verification of architectural principles.

**Key Historical Contribution:**

*   **Feature Alignment and Standardization:** This directory highlights the project's goal to standardize 100% of backend routes and services. It identifies inconsistent patterns as a major problem and positions the Google Maps API implementation as the "EXACT reference model" for how components should be built, integrating proper architectural patterns, RBAC, transaction management, error handling, and modularity.
*   **Addressing Critical Technical Debt:** Detailed plans and guides are provided for tackling specific, pervasive issues:
    *   **Transaction Management:** Establishing and enforcing the critical architectural policy that "ROUTERS OWN TRANSACTION BOUNDARIES, SERVICES DO NOT." This guide provides clear patterns and anti-patterns to resolve transaction conflicts and improve reliability.
    *   **Authentication Standardization:** Documenting the analysis and fix for inconsistent development token acceptance across endpoints, ensuring a unified approach to authentication handling in both development and production.
    *   **Connection Pooling Standardization:** Planning and implementing a method to ensure mandatory Supavisor connection pooling parameters are consistently applied to all database connections, improving reliability and performance.
*   **Emphasis on Testing and Verification:** The directory contains comprehensive testing plans (Feature Alignment Testing Plan) designed to verify the successful implementation of architectural changes and feature alignments. This underscores the importance placed on ensuring system health and integrity through rigorous testing in this phase.
*   **Documenting Implementation Details:** Beyond just plans, documents here provide detailed changes implemented, root cause analyses for issues, and diagrams illustrating correct architectural patterns (like RBAC integration and Transaction Management).

In summary, `/Docs/Docs_2_Feature-Alignment-Testing-Plan` represents the phase where the architectural vision began to be systematically applied and verified across the codebase. It documents the critical fixes implemented for core issues like transaction management and authentication, and establishes the importance of testing and using exemplar implementations to drive standardization.
