# Historical Summary: Docs/Docs_3_ContentMap

This directory served as a central repository for documenting major modernization efforts and solidifying core architectural standards. It represents a critical phase where the project moved decisively away from the "over-engineered nightmare" by addressing pervasive issues and establishing mandatory guidelines.

**Key Historical Contribution:**

*   **Comprehensive Modernization Summary:** This directory contains a high-level executive summary of the entire backend modernization project, highlighting the critical issues addressed (transaction handling, connection pooling, authentication), the architectural patterns established (transaction management, RBAC integration, service modularization, error handling), the systematic standardization approach, and the significant improvements in reliability and performance achieved.
*   **Mandatory Database Standards:** A strong, explicit directive mandates the **exclusive use of SQLAlchemy ORM** for all database interactions. It strictly prohibits raw SQL and legacy connection handlers, positioning services as the sole gatekeepers for database operations. This document underscores the critical pivot made in the previous phase and enforces it as a non-negotiable standard.
*   **Comprehensive Transaction Management:** This directory houses the authoritative guide establishing the mandatory standard for transaction management: **"Routers own transaction boundaries, services are transaction-aware but do not create transactions."** The guide details correct implementation patterns, identifies common anti-patterns, and explains the benefits of this standardized approach for reliability and maintainability.
*   **RBAC System Removal:** Documentation here summarizes the significant effort to remove the over-engineered Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. It details the files backed up and modified to simplify authentication to a JWT-only mechanism, addressing issues caused by the previous complex implementation.

In summary, `/Docs/Docs_3_ContentMap` marks a pivotal point where the project's hard-won lessons were codified into mandatory architectural standards, particularly concerning database interactions and security. It documents the successful resolution of critical issues and provides comprehensive guides that are foundational to the project's current disciplined state.
