# Historical Summary: Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs

This directory serves as a detailed record of the hands-on, iterative refactoring and standardization work performed across the ScraperSky backend. Each subdirectory represents a specific work order, audit, or implementation effort focused on a particular architectural layer, feature, or technical debt area.

**Key Historical Contribution:**

*   **Practical Application of Standards:** This directory demonstrates the practical application of the architectural principles and standards defined in other documentation. The numerous layer-specific subdirectories (e.g., `01-LAYER5_initial-assessment`, `24-LAYER2_Schema-Refactor...`) show where the refactoring efforts were focused in the codebase.
*   **Addressing Technical Debt in Detail:** Specific subdirectories highlight targeted efforts to clean up technical debt, such as database consolidation, error handling improvements, tenant isolation removal, and the auditing and archiving of code.
*   **Feature and Workflow Implementation:** This directory documents the implementation and refactoring of key features and workflows, including various scraping functionalities (Google Maps, Sitemaps, Email Scraper) and background task management.
*   **Granular Standardization Efforts:** Beyond high-level principles, this directory shows efforts to standardize specific aspects like API patterns, naming conventions, service organization, UI components, and CI/CD processes.
*   **Iterative Development:** The dated and numbered subdirectories suggest an iterative approach to modernization, with distinct phases and work orders for tackling different parts of the codebase.

In summary, `/Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs` provides the granular, ground-level view of the project's historical refactoring journey. It is a testament to the significant effort invested in systematically addressing technical debt and implementing the standardized architecture across the codebase, layer by layer and feature by feature.
