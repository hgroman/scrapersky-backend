# Supabase MCP Migration Guide

## Overview

ScraperSky has migrated from Alembic to Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) for database schema management. This guide explains how to use MCP for all schema changes and migrations.

## What is Supabase MCP?

Supabase MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants (like Windsurf/Cursor) to interact with Supabase projects through natural language. It provides tools for:

- Creating and altering database tables
- Managing Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Generating and applying SQL migrations
- Creating and managing database branches
- Viewing database logs and metrics

## Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Personal Access Token (PAT)**: Created in the Supabase dashboard under Settings → Personal access tokens
2. **Windsurf MCP Plugin**: Enable the Supabase MCP plugin in Windsurf's plugin settings and configure it with your PAT

## Migration Structure

Our migrations are stored as plain SQL files:

```
scraper-sky-backend/
└── supabase/
    └── migrations/
        ├── 000_init.sql              # Baseline schema
        └── <timestamp>_<name>.sql    # Subsequent migrations
```

## Working with MCP

### 1. Creating a New Table

Using an AI assistant with MCP support (Windsurf):

1. Open your project in Windsurf with the Supabase MCP plugin enabled
2. Ask the assistant: "Create a table called 'social_media_profiles' with fields for domain_id, platform, handle, url, and metadata"
3. MCP will:
   - Generate SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_social_media_profiles.sql`
   - Apply the migration directly to your Supabase cloud database

### 2. Altering an Existing Table

Ask: "Add a 'priority' integer column with default value 0 to the 'jobs' table"

### 3. Creating RLS Policies

Ask: "Add an RLS policy to the 'page_content' table to restrict access by tenant_id"

### 4. Verifying Schema Changes

You can verify your schema changes by querying the database directly through MCP:

```sql
-- Check applied migrations
SELECT * FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'your_table_name';
```

### 5. Applying Migrations to Production

Migrations are applied directly to your Supabase cloud database through the MCP connection. There is no separate step for applying migrations to production.

## Best Practices

1. **Review Generated Migrations**: Always review SQL files before committing
2. **Write Defensive Migrations**: Use conditional checks in your SQL migrations (e.g., `IF NOT EXISTS`)
3. **Add RLS Policies**: Ensure all tables have proper tenant isolation
4. **Maintain SQLAlchemy Models**: Update model files to match schema changes

## Branching & Isolation

For feature development requiring database changes, you can use Supabase's database branching feature directly through MCP:

```
# Create a branch of the database
mcp0_create_branch --name=feature-name --project_id=your_project_id

# Work with the branch (using the branch project_id returned from create_branch)
# Apply migrations to the branch using the branch project_id

# When ready to merge changes back to production
mcp0_merge_branch --branch_id=branch_id
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**:
   - Verify your PAT token in the Windsurf MCP plugin settings
   - Check Supabase project status in the dashboard
   - Restart Windsurf if needed

2. **Migration Conflicts**:
   - Ensure your migrations use defensive programming with `IF NOT EXISTS` checks
   - If conflicts occur, you may need to create a corrective migration

3. **Schema Verification**:
   - Run SQL queries through MCP to verify table structure and data
