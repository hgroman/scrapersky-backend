My take on Windsurf’s final work‑order
Overall, the plan is well‑structured, production‑oriented, and fully respects your non‑negotiables (Supabase + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + crawl4ai on Render). Nothing in it steers you toward alternative stacks, and the new hardening items (URL normalisation, token‑chunking, content‑hash dedup, DB‑persisted politeness, sitemap bootstrap, OTEL) directly close the last functional gaps we discussed.

Below are a few minor but important tighten‑ups to make sure the work‑order meshes perfectly with the constraints spelled out in your README.md and with the freshest upstream guidance.

Topic	Nudge
No raw SQL in application code	Migrations and Edge‑Function DDL can use SQL, but all runtime DB ops inside FastAPI services must stay ORM‑only. Add an explicit “🔒 ORM‑only” acceptance criterion to every service‑level task so nothing slips in by accident. (See the big warning banner in your README).
Supavisor connection string	Call out the three compatibility flags (raw_sql=true&no_prepare=true&statement_cache_size=0) in the env‑var checklist to prevent “works‑locally‑fails‑on‑Render” surprises.
Row‑Level Security & multi‑tenant IDs	Add a task under “Security and compliance” to review RLS policies on all new tables (domains_crawl_state, page_content_vectors, etc.). This preserves the hard‑won tenant isolation already baked into ScraperSky.
Library pinning	Lock versions in requirements.in / pyproject.toml:
crawl4ai==0.6.* (stream mode arrived in 0.6.0) 
Crawl4AI Documentation

pgvector>=0.5 for HNSW support 
Supabase

Any later major bumps should flow through a scheduled dependency‑review task.
Supabase Automatic Embeddings	Make the Edge‑Function pipeline conform to the Automatic Embeddings guide released in Launch Week 14, which standardises pgmq + trigger wiring 
Supabase
.
HNSW tuning	Keep the recommended m=16, ef_construction=64 defaults, but add a note to expose SET LOCAL hnsw.ef_search per‑query so you can tune recall vs latency at runtime 
GitHub
.
Hash‑based dedup	When you store content_hash, compute SHA‑256 of the text‑only body (after stripping tags) so trivial markup changes don’t defeat dedup.

With those tweaks, I’d call the work‑order “bulletproof enough to execute.”
