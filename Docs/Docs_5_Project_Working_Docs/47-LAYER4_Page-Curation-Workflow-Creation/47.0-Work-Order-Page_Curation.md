# Work Order: Page Curation Workflow Implementation

**Workflow Name:** `page_curation`
**Source Table:** `pages`
**Primary Goal:** Iterate through the `pages` table, visit each page URL, crawl it, and extract relevant information to (initially) update the page record itself (e.g., with curation status, processing status, and extracted content snippets or metadata). The exact destination/update logic for extracted data beyond status fields will be refined as the service is built.

## Phase 0: Foundational Work & Template Enhancement (Completed: 2025-05-07)

This initial phase focused on establishing a robust and standardized foundation before direct implementation of the `page_curation` workflow. Key accomplishments include:

1.  **Comprehensive Review of Workflow Building Process:**

    - Analyzed existing workflow templates and the `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`.
    - Identified areas for improvement, clarification, and standardization in the workflow development lifecycle.

2.  **Enhancement of Master Workflow Template:**

    - The `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/ScraperSky Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet-TEMPLATE.md` (formerly `Docs/Docs_8_Document-X/Templates/ScraperSky Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet-TEMPLATE.md`) underwent significant revisions across all phases (Phase 1 to 5).
    - Key changes involved:
      - Standardizing naming conventions (Python Enums vs. Database Enums, placeholders).
      - Clarifying file paths and module locations (e.g., `src/schemas/{workflow_name}.py`).
      - Refining API endpoint structures, request/response models.
      - Improving guidance on dual-status updates, session management, transactional boundaries.
      - Enhancing examples for scheduler registration, service implementation, HTML/JS components.
      - Restructuring and detailing the testing phase.
    - These changes ensure the template is more aligned with the `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` and provides clearer, more actionable guidance.

3.  **Creation of Template Enhancement Journal:**

    - A detailed log of all changes made to the master template, along with their rationale, was created: `Docs/Docs_8_Document-X/ScraperSky Workflow-Builder-Cheat-Sheet-TEMPLATE-Enhancement-Journal_2025-05-07.md`.

4.  **Initial Scaffolding for `page_curation` Workflow (based on enhanced template):**
    - **Model Updates (`src/models/page.py`):**
      - Added `PageCurationStatus` and `PageProcessingStatus` Python Enums.
      - Added `page_curation_status`, `page_processing_status`, and `page_processing_error` SQLAlchemy columns to the `Page` model, correctly typed with `PgEnum` and referencing the new Python Enums.
    - **API Schemas (`src/schemas/page_curation.py`):**
      - Created `PageCurationUpdateRequest` and `PageCurationUpdateResponse` Pydantic models.
    - **API Router (`src/routers/page_curation.py`):**
      - Created an initial router file with an endpoint `update_page_curation_status_batch` for batch updating page curation statuses. This includes the dual-status update logic (setting processing status to `Queued`).

This foundational work prepares the project for a more standardized and efficient implementation of the `page_curation` workflow and future workflows.

## Next Steps:

- Detailed implementation of the `page_curation_service.py`.
- Implementation of the `page_curation_scheduler.py`.
- Development of UI components for page curation.
- Comprehensive testing.
