# Work Order: Static Directory Review and Cleanup

**Date:** 2024-07-16
**Assignee:** AI Assistant / Developer
**Parent Work Order:** `project-docs/28-CLEAN-UP-Pre-Render/28.3-Post-MVP-Page-Rename-Tasks.md` (Task 2)
**Related Files:** `/static/`, `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md`

## 1. Objective

To review the file structure and contents of the `/static` directory, clarify the purpose and relationships of key HTML files (especially `index.html` and `scraper-sky-mvp.html`), identify unnecessary files (backups, copies, orphans), and perform cleanup to improve project hygiene and maintainability.

## 2. Workflow Steps

1.  **List Static Directory Contents:**

    - **Action:** Obtain a comprehensive listing of all files and subdirectories within the `/static` directory.
    - **Output:** A list of files and folders (e.g., using `ls -R static/`).

2.  **Analyze File Structure and Purpose:**

    - **Action:** Review the file list from Step 1.
    - **Focus:**
      - Identify primary HTML interface pages (e.g., `index.html`, `scraper-sky-mvp.html`, `dev-tools.html`, `admin-dashboard.html`, `batch-domain-scanner.html`, etc.).
      - Identify supporting assets directories (e.g., `/js`, `/css`, `/shared`, `/templates`, `/tabs`).
      - Identify backup files (e.g., `*.bak.*`, `*.bak`).
      - Identify copy files (e.g., `*copy.html`, `* copy.html`).
      - Identify potentially orphaned or unused files (e.g., older test files, unused JS/CSS).
      - Determine the primary entry point (`index.html`?) vs. the main development/testing interface (`scraper-sky-mvp.html`).
    - **Output:** Categorized list of files, identification of the main entry point vs. dev interface, list of files suspected to be unnecessary.

3.  **Clarify File Relationships (Documentation):**

    - **Action:** Based on the analysis, update project documentation if needed to clarify the role of key static HTML files.
    - **Focus:** Ensure `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md` accurately reflects the purpose of `index.html` (if it exists and has a distinct role) and confirms `scraper-sky-mvp.html` as the primary development interface.
    - **Output:** Updated documentation or confirmation that existing documentation is accurate.

4.  **Propose File Deletions:**

    - **Action:** List the specific backup, copy, and confirmed orphan files identified in Step 2 that are proposed for deletion.
    - **Rationale:** Provide clear justification for removal (e.g., "Backup file", "Duplicate functionality", "Unused asset").
    - **Output:** A list of files recommended for deletion.

5.  **Execute File Deletions (Confirmation Required):**
    - **Action:** Upon user confirmation, delete the files proposed in Step 4.
    - **Output:** Confirmation message listing the deleted files.

## 3. Completion Criteria

- The `/static` directory structure and contents have been listed and analyzed.
- The roles of `index.html` (if applicable) and `scraper-sky-mvp.html` are clearly understood and documented.
- A list of unnecessary files (backups, copies, orphans) has been identified.
- Unnecessary files have been deleted after user confirmation.
- Relevant documentation (if necessary) has been updated.
