# Error Handling Consolidation Complete

## What's Been Done

1. We've standardized on `services/error/error_service.py` as our canonical error handling implementation
2. We've added router-level error handling to ALL routers in the application by modifying main.py
3. We've ensured services using error handling are using the correct import

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main.py Updated

We've modified the router registration to wrap all routers with `ErrorService.route_error_handler`:

```python
# For SQLAlchemy routers
for router in sqlalchemy_routers:
    router_with_error_handling = ErrorService.route_error_handler(router)
    app.include_router(router_with_error_handling)

# For regular routers
app.include_router(ErrorService.route_error_handler(google_maps_router))
app.include_router(ErrorService.route_error_handler(sitemap_router))
# etc.
```

This automatically wraps all route handlers with error handling that:
- Logs errors appropriately
- Formats HTTP responses consistently
- Categorizes exceptions to determine the right response code
- Provides user-friendly error messages

### 2. Current Import Pattern

Services using error handling should import like this:

```python
# Correct import
from ...services.error.error_service import error_service
```

### 3. Existing Import Verification

We checked the following files and confirmed they're using the correct import:
- `/services/places/places_search_service.py`
- `/services/batch/batch_processor_service.py`
- `/routers/sitemap_analyzer.py`

### 4. Note on Duplicate Services

We have NOT removed the duplicate error service implementations yet:
- services/core/error_service.py
- services/new/error_service.py

These will be moved to the archive in a future step, but for now we're being conservative.

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Error Handling**: All routes now use the same error handling approach
2. **Better User Experience**: Error responses follow a consistent format
3. **Improved Debugging**: Errors are properly logged with context
4. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Error handling is now done at the router level, removing the need for try/except blocks in route handlers

## Next Steps

1. Verify that the application still works correctly with these changes
2. Look at the other duplicate services (auth, validation, etc.)
3. Eventually archive the unused error service implementations
