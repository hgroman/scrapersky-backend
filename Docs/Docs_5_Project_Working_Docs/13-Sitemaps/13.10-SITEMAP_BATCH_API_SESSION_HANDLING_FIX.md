# 13.10 Sitemap Batch API Session Handling Fix

**Document ID:** 13.10
**Created:** 2025-04-01
**Status:** Implemented
**Type:** Technical Fix Documentation

## 1. Issue Description

The sitemap batch API implementation encountered an error when attempting to use the SQLAlchemy AsyncSession in FastAPI route handlers:

```
ERROR: '_AsyncGeneratorContextManager' object has no attribute 'add'
```

This error occurred because of incorrect session handling when using FastAPI's dependency injection system with SQLAlchemy's AsyncSession.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as a double context manager anti-pattern:

1. The `get_session` function creates a context manager for the session
2. The session was then wrapped in another context manager in the route handler with `async with session.begin():`
3. This created conflict as the session was already being managed by the dependency injection system

## 3. Implementation Changes

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

### 3.1 Session Dependency Change

Changed the session dependency from `get_session` to `get_session_dependency`:

```python
from ..session.async_session import get_session_dependency, get_background_session
```

### 3.2 Route Handler Fix

Modified route handlers to use the session directly without additional context managers:

```python
@router.post("/api/v3/sitemap/batch/create", response_model=SitemapBatchResponse)
async def create_sitemap_batch(
    request: SitemapBatchRequest,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_dependency),
    current_user: dict = Depends(user_dependency),
):
    try:
        # Direct session usage without additional context manager
        # ...database operations...
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling
```

### 3.3 Background Processing Fix

Updated the background processing function to remove unnecessary nested context managers:

```python
async def process_sitemap_batch_with_own_session(...):
    try:
        async with get_background_session() as session:
            # Session already manages its own transaction
            batch = await BatchJob.get_by_batch_id(session, batch_id)
            # ...further operations...
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling
```

## 4. Architectural Pattern Established

This fix established an important architectural pattern for session handling in FastAPI routes:

1. Use `get_session_dependency` for router dependency injection
2. Directly use the injected session without additional context managers
3. For background tasks, use `get_background_session()` with proper context handling
4. Follow the "Routers own transaction boundaries" principle

## 5. Testing Results

After implementing these changes, the sitemap batch API worked correctly:

1. Batch creation endpoint successfully created batch records
2. Background processing correctly handled multiple domains
3. Status endpoint correctly returned batch processing status

## 6. Documentation Updates

The transaction management guide was updated to include a new section on "SESSION HANDLING IN FASTAPI DEPENDENCIES" that documents this pattern for future reference.

## 7. Lessons Learned

1. FastAPI's dependency injection system for sessions requires careful handling
2. Context managers should not be nested when using session dependency injection
3. The distinction between `get_session` and `get_session_dependency` is critical
4. Transaction management patterns must be consistently applied across the codebase
