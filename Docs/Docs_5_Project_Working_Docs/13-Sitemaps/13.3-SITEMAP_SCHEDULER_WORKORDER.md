# Sitemap Scheduler Work Order

## Background

The application requires a sitemap scheduler service that automatically discovers and processes sitemaps for domains. This service will be integrated with the existing sitemap discovery functionality found in `src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py`.

## Objective

Create a background scheduler that periodically checks for domains that need sitemap discovery and leverages the existing sitemap service to process them.

## Existing Components

### Sitemap Discovery Service

The application has an existing sitemap discovery service that:

- Takes a domain URL as input
- Discovers sitemaps for that domain
- Extracts and processes URLs from those sitemaps
- Tracks job status with a job ID

Key files:

- `src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py`: API endpoints for sitemap discovery
- `src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py`: Core processing logic

Notably, the relevant function appears to be `process_domain_with_own_session` which handles the actual sitemap discovery process.

### Existing Database Models

- `src/models/sitemap.py`: Contains the Sitemap model
- `src/models/domain.py`: Contains the Domain model

## Requirements

1. **Scheduler Service**

   - Create a new service at `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
   - Use APScheduler's AsyncIOScheduler for scheduling
   - Configure scheduler with environment variables (interval, batch size, etc.)
   - Integrate with FastAPI's application lifecycle (startup/shutdown)

2. **Processing Logic**

   - Query database for domains that need sitemap discovery
   - Call the existing `process_domain_with_own_session` with appropriate parameters
   - Update domain records with discovery status
   - Handle errors appropriately

3. **Configuration**
   - Add environment variables to docker-compose.yml
   - Follow the pattern used for the domain scheduler

## Implementation Notes

1. Do not modify the existing sitemap processing code
2. The scheduler should only orchestrate when the discovery happens
3. Ensure proper error handling and logging
4. Use the existing database transaction patterns

## Testing Tools

Testing scripts have already been created in `scripts/sitemap_scheduler/`:

- `add_test_sitemap.py`: Creates test data
- `check_sitemap.py`: Checks processing status
- `process_sitemap.py`: Manually processes a sitemap
- `reset_sitemap_status.py`: Resets sitemap statuses
- `monitor_scheduler.py`: Monitors the scheduler

## Deliverables

1. Complete implementation of `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
2. Integration with FastAPI in `src/main.py`
3. Documentation updates with correct information
4. Verification that the scheduler works with the existing sitemap discovery service

## Additional Context

The scheduler needs to understand which domains need sitemap discovery based on some criteria (e.g., domains marked for discovery, domains without recent sitemap scans, etc.). This needs to be determined based on the application's business logic.
