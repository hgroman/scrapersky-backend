# WorkOrder: Search History UI Implementation for Google Maps API

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a search history UI feature in the Google Maps LocalMiner Discovery Scan frontend interface. This feature displays a list of recent searches, allowing users to reuse previous search parameters or view results directly from the search history panel.

## Implementation Details

### Added Features

1. **Recent Searches Panel**

   - A dedicated card in the Single Search tab displays a list of recent searches
   - Each search shows business type, location, date, and action buttons

2. **Search History Retrieval**

   - Fetches search history from the `/api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/history` endpoint
   - Uses JWT authentication and tenant ID for proper data isolation
   - Limit of 10 most recent searches shown in the UI

3. **Interactive UI Elements**

   - **Reuse** button: Populates the search form with parameters from a previous search
   - **Results** button: Directly navigates to the Results Viewer tab and loads results for that search
   - **Refresh** button: Manually refreshes the search history list

4. **Auto-Refresh Functionality**
   - Search history refreshes automatically after completing a new search
   - History refreshes when switching to the Single Search tab

### Code Implementation

#### Recent Searches Panel

Added a card in the Single Search tab that displays the search history in a tabular format with action buttons.

#### JavaScript Functions

1. `fetchSearchHistory()`: Retrieves search history from the API endpoint and builds the UI table
2. `updateSearchHistoryAfterSearch()`: Refreshes the history after a search completes
3. Event listeners for the Reuse and Results buttons to provide seamless user interaction

## User Flow

1. User visits the Single Search tab and sees a list of recent searches
2. User can:
   - Click "Reuse" to populate the search form with parameters from a previous search
   - Click "Results" to go directly to the results from a previous search
   - Click "Refresh" to update the search history list
3. After performing a new search, the search history automatically updates

## Integration Points

- Leverages the existing `/api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/history` API endpoint
- Connects to the existing results viewing functionality
- Integrated with the search status functionality to update history after completion

## Future Enhancements

1. **Duplicate Search Prevention**: Warn users when they attempt to run a search identical to a recent one
2. **Search Filtering**: Allow filtering the history by business type or location
3. **Search Deletion**: Add ability to remove items from search history
4. **Improved Pagination**: Add pagination controls for users with extensive search history

## Testing

- The implementation has been tested with various search parameters
- Confirmed proper display of search history entries
- Verified that "Reuse" correctly populates the search form
- Validated that "Results" correctly navigates to and displays search results

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a foundation for improved user experience by making historical searches accessible and reusable. It establishes the groundwork for future duplicate search prevention and enhances the overall usability of the Google Maps LocalMiner Discovery Scan feature.
