# Continuous Integration (CI) Enforcement Work Order

_Last updated: 2025-05-04T10:10:23-07:00_

## Purpose
Establish bulletproof CI enforcement for workflow documentation and codebase standards in the ScraperSky backend. The goal is to automate validation, ensure audit readiness, and maintain architectural compliance for all workflows and supporting files.

---

## Scope
- All workflow canonical YAMLs in `Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/`
- Linear steps and dependency trace docs
- `python_file_status_map.md` and artifact trackers
- All backend Python source files (for SQL/ORM compliance)

---

## Required Automated Checks
- [ ] **YAML Schema Validation:** All workflow YAMLs must pass JSON schema validation
- [ ] **Artifact Cross-Referencing:** Ensure all files referenced in YAML, linear steps, and python_file_status_map.md are consistent
- [ ] **Raw SQL Scan:** Flag any direct SQL usage (must enforce ORM-only policy)
- [ ] **Artifact Tracker Update:** Confirm artifact completion tracker is up to date
- [ ] **python_file_status_map.md Sync:** Validate that mapping is current and all files are properly annotated
- [ ] **No Deprecated/Legacy Endpoints:** Enforce v3 API versioning only
- [ ] **Architectural Mandate Enforcement:** Confirm all architectural requirements are met (transaction boundaries, JWT/auth separation, etc.)
- [ ] **Progress Logging:** CI must log validation results and block merges on failure

---

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning
- [ ] Review all audit protocols and architectural mandates
- [ ] Define CI requirements and success criteria

### Phase 2: Tool Selection & Pipeline Design
- [ ] Select schema validation tools (e.g., yamllint, custom scripts)
- [ ] Choose code scanning tools for raw SQL/ORM enforcement (e.g., regex, AST-based)
- [ ] Design artifact cross-check scripts
- [ ] Plan CI pipeline integration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

### Phase 3: Pipeline Setup & Enforcement
- [ ] Implement and test all CI checks
- [ ] Integrate with repository (block merges on failure)
- [ ] Document CI process for contributors

### Phase 4: Reporting & Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Set up CI reporting (logs, dashboards, notifications)
- [ ] Review and improve checks as needed
- [ ] Regularly audit CI effectiveness

---

## CI Enforcement Readiness Checklist
- [ ] All required checks implemented and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated for contributors
- [ ] CI pipeline blocks non-compliant changes
- [ ] Audit logs and reports available
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of enforcement start
