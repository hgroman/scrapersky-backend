# Work Order 41.40: Raw SQL Refactoring Analysis

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Author:** Hank Groman & AI Assistant (Gemini)
**Version:** 1.1 (Updated after confirming `db_service.py` was unused and archived)

## Context

Following the successful verification of application stability (documented in `41.33-Verification-Results.md` and `41.35-Progress-Tracker.md`), we are now positioned to address critical technical debt issues identified during the ScraperSky Backend Code Audit: **multiple instances of non-compliant raw SQL usage that violate the project's ORM-only architectural standard.**

Initial analysis targeted `src/services/core/db_service.py` as a potential source of this debt for several features. However, further investigation confirmed that `db_service.py` and its primary consumer `src/services/storage/storage_service.py` were **unused by critical application paths**. These files have been archived.

This work order now focuses on the remaining confirmed instances of raw SQL found within components supporting the BatchProcessing, DBPortal, and DevTool features.

This work order builds upon the foundation established in documents:

- `41.14-Handover-Document.md` (identifying architectural violations)
- `41.15-MICRO WORK ORDER: Analysis of Raw SQL Dependencies...` (original analysis plan)
- `41.22-DTree-Batch-Domain-Scanner.md`, `41.23-DTree-Single-Domain-Scanner.md`, and `41.24-DTree-Content-Map.md` (dependency traces for affected features)
- `41.37.1-RawSQL-Analysis-Findings.md` (Companion document with detailed findings)

## Objective

Perform a comprehensive analysis of **the confirmed raw SQL usage within the components supporting key features (BatchProcessing, DBPortal, and DevTool)** to:

1. Document all instances of raw SQL usage in the relevant files (`db_inspector.py`, `sitemap_handler.py`, `page_scraper/processing_service.py`, `routers/batch_page_scraper.py`, `routers/dev_tools.py`). (Completed in `41.37.1`)
2. Identify equivalent ORM-compliant approaches for each instance (excluding `db_inspector.py` which is intentional).
3. Create a detailed refactoring plan for these specific raw SQL usages.

This analysis will provide the foundation for a future refactoring effort to eliminate these architectural violations and improve code maintainability.

## Background

The ScraperSky backend architecture mandates SQLAlchemy ORM usage for all database operations. However, **several components bypass this requirement by using raw SQL queries, violating the ORM-only principle.**

Key features rely on components containing this non-compliant raw SQL:

1. **BatchProcessing** (via `batch_page_scraper.py` which uses `page_scraper/processing_service.py` containing raw SQL, and the router itself containing raw SQL)
2. **DBPortal** (via `db_portal.py` which uses `db_inspector.py` containing extensive, but intentional, raw SQL for introspection)
3. **DevTool** (via `dev_tools.py` which uses `sitemap_handler.py` containing extensive raw SQL, and the router itself containing raw SQL)

_Note: `db_service.py` and `storage_service.py` were found to be unused and have been archived._

## Tasks

### 1. Source Code Analysis (2 hours) - COMPLETED

1.1. Analyze identified files containing raw SQL: (`db_inspector.py`, `sitemap_handler.py`, `page_scraper/processing_service.py`, `routers/batch_page_scraper.py`, `routers/dev_tools.py`). - Document the specific SQL patterns used in each file. - Identify parameter passing mechanisms for each raw SQL call. - Note any transaction management context or special SQL features used alongside the raw SQL.

_Findings documented in `41.37.1-RawSQL-Analysis-Findings.md`_

### 2. ORM Equivalence Analysis (3 hours) - NEXT STEP

2.1. For each distinct raw SQL pattern identified in Task 1 (excluding `db_inspector.py`): - Document the equivalent SQLAlchemy ORM approach (using models like `Domain`, `Job`, `SitemapFile`, etc., or core SQLAlchemy functions). - Note any challenges or limitations in direct translation (e.g., complex joins, performance considerations for specific queries). - Provide code examples of the ORM equivalent.

2.2. Create a mapping table in `41.37.1-RawSQL-Analysis-Findings.md` with the following columns: - File containing raw SQL - Specific raw SQL block/function - Dependent features using it (indirectly) - Equivalent ORM pattern/approach - Implementation complexity (Low/Medium/High) - Migration risk (Low/Medium/High)

### 3. Refactoring Strategy Development (2 hours)

3.1. Based on Tasks 1 and 2, document in `41.37.1-RawSQL-Analysis-Findings.md` a recommended refactoring approach for each identified raw SQL block (excluding `db_inspector.py`): - Direct replacement with ORM equivalent. - Potential refactoring of the surrounding service/handler logic. - Any special considerations or prerequisites (e.g., model updates).

3.2. Prioritize the refactoring order based on: - Frequency/impact of the raw SQL usage. - Complexity/risk of the raw SQL block. - Dependencies between components.

3.3. Create a phased implementation plan with clear milestones for addressing these specific raw SQL instances.

### 4. Documentation & Deliverables (1 hour)

Produce the following documentation (primarily consolidating findings from `41.37.1`):

- Comprehensive raw SQL usage analysis document (mapping blocks to features/files) - _Covered by `41.37.1`_
- ORM equivalence mapping for identified raw SQL blocks - _To be added to `41.37.1`_
- Refactoring strategy document for the identified raw SQL - _To be added to `41.37.1`_
- Implementation plan with timeline estimates - _To be added to `41.37.1`_

## Safety Considerations

- This work order focuses on analysis only, not implementation
- No actual code changes should be made at this stage
- All documentation should be created in the `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/` directory
- The analysis should assume the application is in the verified stable state documented in `41.33-Verification-Results.md`

## Success Criteria

This work order will be considered complete when:

1. All identified instances of raw SQL usage within the components supporting the target features (excluding `db_inspector.py`) are thoroughly documented in `41.37.1`. - COMPLETED
2. Equivalent ORM patterns are identified for these raw SQL operations in `41.37.1`.
3. A clear, phased refactoring strategy is produced in `41.37.1`.
4. The documentation (`41.37.1`) is organized in a way that enables future implementation.

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon successful completion of this analysis:

1. Review the findings and strategy with the team
2. Create targeted work orders for implementing the refactoring of the identified raw SQL blocks in phases
3. Implement the changes with continuous verification of application stability
