## Runtime Analysis - Unused Code Detection (2025-04-25)

**Goal:** Implement runtime analysis to identify unused Python modules (`.py` files) within the `/app/src` directory.

**Initial Approach (Attempt 1 - Module Tracer):**

1.  **User Request:** Add a _new_ runtime module tracer (`src.config.runtime_module_tracer`) to `src/main.py`.
    - Import `start_tracing`, `stop_tracing`, `save_results`.
    - Call `start_tracing()` in the `lifespan` startup.
    - Call `stop_tracing()` and `save_results()` in the `lifespan` shutdown.
2.  **Discovery:** Read `src/main.py` and found an _existing_ file tracer (`src.config.runtime_tracer`) already integrated into the `lifespan` function.
3.  **Clarification:** Asked user how to proceed (replace, keep both, remove old).

**Revised Approach (Attempt 2 - Enhance Existing Tracer):**

1.  **User Request:** Update the _existing_ tracer (`src/config/runtime_tracer.py`) to track module names in addition to file paths.
    - Add `LOADED_MODULES: Set[str] = set()`.
    - Modify `trace_calls` to calculate and add module paths (e.g., `src.routers.profile`) to `LOADED_MODULES` when a file in `/app/src/` is loaded.
    - Add `get_loaded_modules()` function to retrieve the set.
2.  **Action:** Read `src/config/runtime_tracer.py`.
3.  **Action:** Applied requested code changes to `src/config/runtime_tracer.py`.
    - _Linter Error:_ Encountered a type error with `sys.settrace(None)`. Attempted fixes with `# type: ignore[arg-type]` comments on `sys.settrace` and `threading.settrace`. (Linter status after second fix attempt is unclear from logs).
4.  **User Request:** Proceed with next steps: update `src/main.py` to use the enhanced tracer and then run the analysis.
5.  **Action:** Updated `src/main.py`:
    - Imported `get_loaded_modules` from `src.config.runtime_tracer`.
    - Modified the `lifespan` shutdown logic to call `get_loaded_modules()` and log the results (count and list of module names) using `logger.info(f"LOADED_MODULE: {module_name}")`.
6.  **User Request:** Restart server and run the analysis script (`run_runtime_analysis.sh`).
7.  **Action:** Restarted the `scrapersky` Docker container (`docker-compose up -d --build scrapersky`).
8.  **Action:** Attempted to run `./run_runtime_analysis.sh`.
    - _Error:_ Permission denied.
9.  **Action:** Granted execute permissions (`chmod +x run_runtime_analysis.sh`) and ran `./run_runtime_analysis.sh` again.
10. **Outcome & Issues:**
    - The script completed.
    - **Issue 1:** The application logs showed `Total unique /app/src/*.py files loaded: 0` and `Total unique src.* modules loaded: 0`. The tracer did not record any loads within `/app/src`.
    - **Issue 2:** The analysis script (`tools/analyze_runtime_results.py`) failed, reporting `Error: reports/runtime_loaded_files.txt does not exist!` and incorrectly listed all 90 files in `src/` as unused in `reports/unused_files.json`. This script needs updating to parse the actual application logs for `LOADED_MODULE:` lines instead of relying on a separate file.
11. **Diagnosis:** The primary problem is that the `sys.settrace` mechanism isn't capturing the intended calls within the running application environment (potentially due to Uvicorn workers, threading, or Docker path issues). The analysis script is also outdated.
12. **Next Proposed Step (Paused):** Suggested adding debug logging (e.g., `os.getcwd()`, list `/app/src`) within `src/main.py`'s `lifespan` to investigate the path context seen by the running application, before further debugging the tracer itself.

**Current Status:** Paused further action to document progress as requested by the user. The runtime tracing is not currently functional, and the analysis script needs modification.

**Resuming Troubleshooting (2025-04-25):**

**Plan:** Add debug logging to `src/main.py` within the `lifespan` context manager to investigate the execution environment's perspective on file paths.

- Log `os.getcwd()` to see the current working directory.
- Log `os.listdir('/app/src')` (within a try-except block) to see the contents of the source directory as seen by the running process.

**Action:** Added `os.getcwd()` and `os.listdir('/app/src')` logging statements within a try-except block at the beginning of the `lifespan` function in `src/main.py`.

**Action:** Restarted the `scrapersky` Docker container (`docker-compose up -d --build scrapersky`).

**Action:** Stopped the `scrapersky` container using `docker-compose stop scrapersky` to trigger shutdown logging.

**Action:** Retrieved container logs using `docker-compose logs scrapersky`.

**Findings:**

- Logs confirmed the application process within the container ran with CWD `/app`.
- Logs confirmed `/app/src` was accessible.
- **Success:** The shutdown logs now contain `LOADED_SRC_FILE:` and `LOADED_MODULE:` entries, indicating the tracer worked correctly in the container context (captured 17 modules/files in this run).

**Plan:** Modify `run_runtime_analysis.sh` to execute the server startup, endpoint exercising, and analysis steps _inside_ the running `scrapersky` container using `docker-compose exec`.

**Action:** Updated `run_runtime_analysis.sh` to orchestrate the process: - Ensure container is up (`docker-compose up -d --build`). - Exercise endpoints (`docker-compose exec`). - Stop container (`docker-compose stop`) to trigger logging. - Pipe logs into the analysis script (`docker-compose logs | docker-compose exec -T`).

**Outcome:** Script failed. 1. `exercise_endpoints.py` (run via `exec`) could not connect to `localhost:8000` inside the container. 2. The final `docker-compose exec` for the analysis script failed because the container was stopped.

**Revised Plan:** 1. Run `exercise_endpoints.py` from the HOST machine, connecting to the mapped port `http://localhost:8000` (assuming standard port mapping). 2. Modify `run_runtime_analysis.sh` to: - Start container (`up -d --build`). - Run exerciser from host (`python tools/exercise_endpoints.py --base-url http://localhost:8000`). - Stop container (`stop`). - Get logs (`logs`) and pipe into the analysis script running in a temporary container (`docker-compose run --rm scrapersky python tools/analyze_runtime_results.py`).

**Action:** Updated `run_runtime_analysis.sh` with the revised logic (exerciser runs on host, analysis runs in temporary container via `docker-compose run`).
