# Unused Code Candidate Audit (Generated: $(date +'%Y-%m-%d'))

This document outlines the process for manually reviewing the potentially unused code candidates identified by the `tools/run_full_trace.py` script.

**Source Report:** `reports/unused_candidates.json` (Generated on $(date +'%Y-%m-%d'))
**Total Candidates:** 21 (as of last run)

## Evaluation Process

The following steps will be taken for _each_ candidate file listed below:

1.  **Display Candidate File:** The full path of the candidate file will be presented.
2.  **Read Code:** The contents of the candidate file will be read and displayed to understand its purpose, functions, classes, etc.
3.  **Initial Assessment:** Based on the filename and code content, make a preliminary judgment:
    - Does the name suggest an obsolete feature?
    - Does the functionality seem redundant or replaced?
4.  \*\*Codebase Search (within `src/`):
    - Search for the filename (e.g., `my_module`).
    - Search for key identifiers (class names, function names) defined within the file.
    - Look for exact string matches that might indicate dynamic loading or configuration references.
5.  \*\*Check for Indirect Usage:
    - **Framework Hooks:** Could FastAPI (or another framework) be loading this implicitly (e.g., via naming conventions, decorators not easily traced by AST)?
    - **Configuration Files:** Is the file or its contents referenced in `.env`, YAML, or other config files?
    - **Database Interactions:** Is it related to SQLAlchemy models, Alembic migrations, or specific DB operations in a way missed by static analysis?
    - **Templates:** (Less likely for `src/`) Is it used within any template files?
6.  **Developer Knowledge Check:** Leverage project-specific knowledge:
    - Is this part of a known feature (current or deprecated)?
    - Does this relate to recent refactoring or changes?
7.  **Decision:** Based on the gathered evidence, classify the file:
    - `[ ] CONFIRM UNUSED`: High confidence the file is safe to archive. No significant evidence of usage found.
    - `[ ] CONFIRM USED`: Clear evidence of direct or indirect usage found. Remove from archive list.
    - `[ ] UNCERTAIN`: Ambiguous results or insufficient confidence. Flag for deeper investigation or keep for safety.

## Candidate List & Review

_(This section will be populated as we review each candidate)_

---

### Candidate 1: [File Path]

- **Code Summary:** [Brief description based on reading]
- **Search Results:** [Summary of codebase search findings]
- **Indirect Usage Check:** [Notes on potential indirect usage]
- **Developer Notes:** [Input from user]
- **Decision:** `[ ] CONFIRM UNUSED` / `[ ] CONFIRM USED` / `[ ] UNCERTAIN`

---

### Candidate 2: [File Path]

- **Code Summary:** ...
- **Search Results:** ...
- **Indirect Usage Check:** ...
- **Developer Notes:** ...
- **Decision:** `[ ] CONFIRM UNUSED` / `[ ] CONFIRM USED` / `[ ] UNCERTAIN`

---

_(Repeat for all candidates)_

## Final Outcome

- **Files Confirmed Unused:** [List of files to be archived]
- **Files Confirmed Used:** [List of files removed from consideration]
- **Files Remaining Uncertain:** [List of files needing further review]

## Action Plan

1.  Archive all files marked as `CONFIRM UNUSED` to the `_Archive_YYYYMMDD/` directory.
2.  Commit changes with a clear message referencing this audit document.
3.  Address any `UNCERTAIN` files as needed.
