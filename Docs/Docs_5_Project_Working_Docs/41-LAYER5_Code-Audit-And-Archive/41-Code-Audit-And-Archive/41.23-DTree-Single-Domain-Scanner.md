# Dependency Tree: Single Domain Scanner

This document maps the dependency chain for the Single Domain Scanner feature, starting from the frontend HTML file down to the Python backend components.

## 1. Frontend

- **File:** `static/single-domain-scanner.html`
- **Description:** Provides the user interface for entering a single domain and viewing scan status and results.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Embedded within the HTML (`<script>` block).
  - Handles UI interactions, form submission.
  - Makes API calls to initiate and monitor a single domain scan job.

## 2. API Endpoints Called

- **`POST /api/v3/batch_page_scraper/scan`**
  - **Purpose:** Initiates a new single domain scanning job.
  - **Called by:** Form submission handler JavaScript function.
- **`GET /api/v3/batch_page_scraper/status/{job_id}`**
  - **Purpose:** Retrieves the status and progress of the single domain scan job.
  - **Called by:** `pollStatus()` JavaScript function (using `status_url` from initial response).

## 3. Backend Router

- **File:** `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`
- **Description:** Defines the FastAPI router and implements the API endpoints listed above (alongside the batch endpoints).
- **Key Endpoint Functions (Single Scan Related):**
  - `scan_domain()`: Handles the `POST /scan` request.
  - `get_job_status()`: Handles the `GET /status/{job_id}` request.
- **Direct Dependencies:** (See full list in Batch Scanner DTree - `41.22-...`) Includes:
  - `FastAPI`, `SQLAlchemy`, `logging`, `os`, `uuid`, `datetime`
  - `src.auth.jwt_auth`
  - `src.config.settings`
  - `src.models`
  - `src.schemas.job`
  - `src.services.page_scraper`
  - `src.session.async_session`
  - `src.utils.db_helpers`
  - **Note:** Also imports batch-related services (`src.services.batch.*`) even if not used directly by these specific endpoints.

## 4. Service Layer & Deeper Dependencies

The service layer dependencies initiated by `scan_domain()` and `get_job_status()` within `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py` follow the same chain identified in the Batch Domain Scanner analysis:

- **`src/services/page_scraper/processing_service.py`** (and its related `domain_processor.py` called via background task).
- These depend on:
  - `src/services/core/validation_service.py`
  - `src/services/storage/metadata_storage_service.py`
  - `src/services/job_service.py`
  - `src/scrapers/metadata_scraper.py`
- Which in turn rely on imports established via:
  - `src/services/core/__init__.py` (pulling in `db_service`, `user_context_service`, `validation_service`)

**Conclusion:** The backend dependency chain is effectively the same as documented in `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.22-DTree-Batch-Domain-Scanner.md`.

## 5. Critical Files Confirmed Needed

This analysis confirms the necessity of the same set of files identified during the batch scanner investigation:

- `src/services/batch/batch_functions.py` (Imported by router)
- `src/services/batch/batch_processor_service.py` (Imported by router)
- `src/services/batch/types.py` (Imported by router)
- `src/services/core/db_service.py` (Imported via chain)
- `src/services/core/validation_service.py` (Imported via chain)
- `src/services/core/user_context_service.py` (Imported via chain)
- `src/utils/db_helpers.py` (Imported by router)
