# Work Order: `/static` Directory Audit & Legacy HTML Identification (Phase 1)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-18
**Status:** Open
**Assignee:** AI Assistant / User
**Related Files:** `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/0.0_AI_Project_Primer.md`, `README.md`, `src/main.py`, `src/routers/`, `/static/`

**1. Objective**

- Establish a canonical, machine-readable list of all _current_ (v3) API endpoints available in the backend.
- Audit all top-level `.html` files within the `/static` directory to identify which API endpoints they consume, considering their linked JavaScript dependencies.
- Identify and categorize `.html` files that _solely_ rely on legacy (non-v3) or demonstrably non-existent API endpoints, marking these standalone legacy interfaces for archival/removal in this first phase of cleanup.

**2. Background & Context**

Following recent investigations and documentation consolidation (resulting in `0.0_AI_Project_Primer.md`), it's clear the `/static` directory contains numerous `.html` files created over different development phases. While `/static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` is the designated primary testing interface (relying heavily on JS modules in `/static/js/` and resources in `/static/shared/`), many other top-level HTML files likely exist that reference outdated (pre-v3) or now-removed API endpoints.

To streamline development, reduce confusion, and prepare for potential future frontend work, a systematic audit is required. This work order covers Phase 1: establishing the API source of truth and identifying the low-hanging fruit â€“ _standalone_ static HTML files that are demonstrably unusable because they only reference legacy endpoints. Subsequent phases will address files with mixed or current endpoint usage. This phase does not involve refactoring the core `scraper-sky-mvp.html` application structure or its essential JS dependencies.

**3. Requirements**

1.  **Generate Canonical Endpoint List:**
    - Programmatically inspect `src/main.py` and all routers included from `src/routers/` (including sub-routers).
    - Create a definitive list of all registered API routes under the `/api/v3/` prefix.
    - The list should include:
      - Full path (e.g., `/api/v3/domains/{domain_id}`)
      - HTTP Method(s) (e.g., GET, POST, PUT)
      - Source file/function defining the endpoint (e.g., `src/routers/domains.py:read_domain`)
2.  **Inventory Static HTML Files:**
    - List all `.html` files residing directly within the `/static` directory.
    - _(Note: Files within subdirectories `/static/js/` and `/static/shared/` contain essential JavaScript modules and shared assets, respectively, primarily required by `scraper-sky-mvp.html`. These directories are not targets for archival in this phase.)_
3.  **Audit HTML File API Usage:**
    - For each inventoried top-level `.html` file, analyze its content and **any directly linked JavaScript files (especially those found in `/static/js/`)**.
    - Identify all backend API calls made by the JavaScript (look for `fetch`, `axios`, `XMLHttpRequest` calls, typically targeting `/api/...`).
4.  **Categorize HTML Files:**
    - **Category 1 (Legacy Only):** The file _only_ makes calls to API endpoints NOT present in the canonical v3 list generated in Requirement 1.
    - **Category 2 (Current Only):** The file _only_ makes calls to API endpoints that ARE present in the canonical v3 list.
    - **Category 3 (Mixed):** The file makes calls to _both_ current v3 endpoints AND legacy/non-existent endpoints.
    - **Category 4 (No Backend Calls):** The file does not appear to make any calls to `/api/...` endpoints.
    - **Category 5 (Known Good):** Mark `/static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` explicitly.

**4. Deliverables**

1.  **Canonical Endpoint Document:** A new document (e.g., `project-docs/38-Static-Audit/38.1-Current-v3-API-Endpoints.md` or `.json`) containing the definitive list generated in Requirement 1.
2.  **HTML Audit Report:** A new document (e.g., `project-docs/38-Static-Audit/38.2-Static-HTML-Audit-Phase1.md`) listing each inventoried `.html` file from `/static` and its assigned category (1-5) based on the audit in Requirement 4.

**5. Proposed Process (Phase 1)**

1.  AI generates the Canonical Endpoint List (Deliverable 1) by analyzing backend code.
2.  AI lists the relevant `.html` files in `/static`.
3.  AI attempts to audit the API calls for each HTML file (may require reading file contents and associated JS).
4.  AI produces the HTML Audit Report (Deliverable 2) with categorizations.
5.  User reviews Deliverable 2 and archives/deletes files designated as Category 1 (Legacy Only).

**6. Acceptance Criteria (Phase 1)**

- The Canonical Endpoint List document accurately reflects all `/api/v3/` routes.
- The HTML Audit Report correctly lists and categorizes the top-level static HTML files based on their API calls.
- Files solely dependent on legacy APIs (Category 1) are clearly identified for removal/archival.
