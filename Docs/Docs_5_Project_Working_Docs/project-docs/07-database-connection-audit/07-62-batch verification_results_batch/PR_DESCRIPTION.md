# PR: Complete Batch Scraper Implementation

## Summary

This PR completes the batch scraper implementation with improved error handling, comprehensive status tracking, and enhanced domain processing feedback. The implementation now properly handles all edge cases, provides detailed status information, and ensures proper transaction boundaries for database operations.

## Changes

1. **Enhanced Domain Processing Feedback**

   - Added detailed result tracking for each domain in a batch
   - Included processing time metrics for performance analysis
   - Improved error reporting with specific failure reasons

2. **Improved Batch Status Reporting**

   - Enhanced status endpoint to provide comprehensive batch information
   - Added progress calculation for real-time monitoring
   - Included domain-specific status details in responses

3. **Transaction Boundary Management**

   - Ensured proper transaction boundaries in all database operations
   - Fixed session management in background tasks
   - Used the recommended `get_background_session()` context manager

4. **Standardized Status URL Format**
   - Ensured consistent URL format across all parts of the codebase
   - Fixed endpoint format inconsistencies

## Testing

All changes have been thoroughly tested using:

1. Unit tests for each component
2. Integration tests for the complete workflow
3. Verification script that tests different domain scenarios
4. Manual testing of error recovery and edge cases

## Verification Results

✅ **Router Layer:**

- Proper transaction boundaries established
- `BackgroundTasks` correctly used for background processing
- Comprehensive error handling implemented

✅ **Service Layer:**

- Transaction-aware design (no direct session creation)
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Input validation added

✅ **Domain Processing:**

- Uses `get_background_session()` for database operations
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Detailed domain result reporting

✅ **Batch Functions:**

- Correct session management
- Comprehensive status tracking
- Enhanced metadata management

## Next Steps

The batch scraper implementation is now complete and ready for use. Potential future improvements:

1. Add cancellation endpoint to terminate in-progress batches
2. Implement batch prioritization for optimized processing
3. Add more detailed statistics about domain processing
