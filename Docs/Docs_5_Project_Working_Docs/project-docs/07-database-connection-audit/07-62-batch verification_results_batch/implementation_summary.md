# Batch Scraper Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Enhanced Domain Processing Feedback**

   - Added detailed domain processing results to batch metadata
   - Included timestamps and processing duration for each domain
   - Stored comprehensive error information for failed domains
   - Updated metadata during processing for real-time status updates

2. **Improved Batch Status Reporting**

   - Enhanced `get_batch_status` function to include progress calculation
   - Added processing time calculation
   - Included domain-specific status information in the response
   - Added proper datetime handling and formatting

3. **Updated Type Definitions**

   - Enhanced `BatchStatus` TypedDict with additional fields
   - Ensured consistency between service layer and API responses

4. **Fixed Router Response**
   - Updated `get_batch_status_endpoint` to include domain status information
   - Standardized status URL format across the codebase

## Batch Processing Workflow

The batch processing workflow now functions as follows:

1. User sends a request to `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/batch` with a list of domains
2. Router validates the request and calls `initiate_batch_processing`
3. Service creates a batch record and returns batch information
4. Router adds a background task to process the batch with `process_batch_with_own_session`
5. Background task processes each domain with its own session
6. Detailed domain results are stored in batch metadata
7. Batch status is updated after each domain is processed
8. Final batch status is updated when processing is complete
9. User can check batch status at `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/batch/{batch_id}/status`

## Verification Test Plan

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

1. **Create Batch with Valid Domains**

   - Expected: Batch creation successful, processing starts
   - Verify: Batch record created, status initially "pending"

2. **Create Batch with No Domains**

   - Expected: Error response with validation message
   - Verify: Proper error handling in the router

3. **Create Batch with Invalid Domains**

   - Expected: Batch creation successful with only valid domains
   - Verify: Invalid domains are filtered out, processing proceeds with valid domains

4. **Get Status of Nonexistent Batch**
   - Expected: Error response indicating batch not found
   - Verify: Proper error handling in status endpoint

### 2. Processing Tests

1. **Monitor Batch Processing Progress**

   - Expected: Status transitions from "pending" to "processing" to "completed"
   - Verify: Progress percentage increases as domains are processed

2. **Verify Domain Processing Results**

   - Expected: Each domain has detailed result information
   - Verify: Domain statuses include processing times and outcome information

3. **Handle Mixed Success/Failure**

   - Create batch with mix of valid/invalid domains
   - Expected: Some domains succeed, some fail
   - Verify: Final status reflects partial success

4. **Handle All Failures**
   - Create batch with all invalid domains
   - Expected: All domains fail, batch status is "failed"
   - Verify: Error information is properly recorded

### 3. Advanced Tests

1. **Concurrent Batch Processing**

   - Create multiple batches simultaneously
   - Expected: All batches process correctly without interference
   - Verify: Each batch maintains independent state and progress

2. **Large Batch Processing**

   - Create batch with large number of domains (100+)
   - Expected: Successfully processes all domains
   - Verify: Handles resource constraints appropriately

3. **Recovery from Errors**

   - Simulate processing errors in some domains
   - Expected: Batch processing continues despite errors
   - Verify: Errors are properly recorded, other domains still process

4. **Database Connection Errors**
   - Simulate temporary database disconnection
   - Expected: Reconnection and continued processing
   - Verify: Resilient to connection issues

### 4. API Response Verification

1. **Verify Status Response Structure**

   - Compare response against `BatchStatusResponse` model
   - Expected: All required fields present
   - Verify: Response structure matches documentation

2. **Verify Domain Status Information**

   - Check domain_statuses field in response
   - Expected: Detailed status for each domain
   - Verify: Contains processing time, start/end time, and result

3. **Verify Status URL Format**
   - Check status_url in batch creation response
   - Expected: Standardized format `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/batch/{batch_id}/status`
   - Verify: URL is valid and points to correct endpoint

## Execution Instructions

1. Start the application with `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Execute test cases using the test script at `scripts/batch/verify_background_tasks.py`
3. Monitor logs for any errors or warnings
4. Verify database state after each test
5. Document any remaining issues or edge cases
