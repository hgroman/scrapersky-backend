# Code Fixes Summary for Batch Processing

This document summarizes all code fixes and improvements implemented to address batch processing issues in the ScraperSky backend.

## Summary of Issues

1. **Background Task Execution**: FastAPI background tasks for batch processing were failing silently, leaving batches in a "pending" status indefinitely.
2. **Session Management**: Improper session management in background tasks was causing transaction isolation problems.
3. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error reporting in background processes made it difficult to diagnose failures.
4. **Type Safety**: Several type-related linter errors in various components of the system.
5. **Database Schema Mismatch**: Code attempting to update a non-existent `domain_statuses` column in the `batch_jobs` table.

### 6. Database Schema Alignment

#### Fixed BatchJob Update Operations

```python
# src/services/batch/batch_processor_service.py
```

- Fixed database update operations that were trying to update a non-existent `domain_statuses` column
- Modified code to store domain status information in the existing `batch_metadata` JSONB column
- Ensured compatibility with existing database schema to avoid requiring migrations
- Fixed "Unconsumed column names: domain_statuses" error that was causing batch processing to fail

##### Issue Details

The `batch_processor_service.py` file was attempting to update a `domain_statuses` column that doesn't exist in the `batch_jobs` table. Specifically, in the `process_batch_with_own_session` function, these SQL operations were failing:

```python
update_stmt = update(BatchJob).where(
    BatchJob.batch_id == batch_uuid,
    BatchJob.tenant_id == tenant_uuid
).values(
    completed_domains=completed,
    progress=progress,
    domain_statuses=domain_statuses,  # This column doesn't exist in the database
    updated_at=datetime.utcnow()
)
```

We verified this issue using the database inspection script `simple_inspect.py`, which confirmed the `batch_jobs` table schema has no `domain_statuses` column, but does include a `batch_metadata` JSONB column that is designed for storing this type of information.

##### Implementation Approach

We modified the SQL update operations to use the existing `batch_metadata` JSONB column instead:

```python
update_stmt = update(BatchJob).where(
    BatchJob.batch_id == batch_uuid,
    BatchJob.tenant_id == tenant_uuid
).values(
    completed_domains=completed,
    progress=progress,
    batch_metadata={"domain_statuses": domain_statuses},  # Store in JSONB column
    updated_at=datetime.utcnow()
)
```

This change was applied to all locations in `batch_processor_service.py` where domain status information was being stored directly in a non-existent column. The code now correctly uses the JSONB column to store the structured data, which is the intended pattern for this type of information according to the database design.

##### Verification Process

To verify the fix, we:

1. Examined the database schema using `simple_inspect.py` to confirm the `batch_jobs` table structure
2. Implemented the necessary changes to use the `batch_metadata` JSONB column
3. Tested the fix by creating new batches with multiple domains
4. Verified successful batch processing through API status checks
5. Confirmed the batch data was properly stored in the database
6. Monitored logs for any errors related to column mapping

##### Results

The fix successfully resolved the "Unconsumed column names: domain_statuses" error:

- New batches were successfully created and processed
- Domain status information was correctly stored in the `batch_metadata` JSONB column
- The API correctly returned status information from the JSONB column
- No database errors were encountered during testing

##### Noteworthy Observations

1. While fixing this issue, we observed that a long-running batch job (ID: 59ebabe3-68ec-40eb-bdc6-9bed2c0d39f2) remained in a pending state for over 11,000 seconds. This indicates a potential issue with batch job recovery that may need additional investigation.

2. The fix maintains backward compatibility with API clients, as the API response format remains unchanged - domain status information is still returned in the same structure even though it's stored differently in the database.

3. This approach aligns with modern database practices of using JSONB columns for flexible metadata storage rather than adding columns for specific data points.

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the immediate issues with batch processing while setting the stage for more robust long-term solutions. The combination of enhanced diagnostics, improved error handling, and architectural recommendations provides both immediate relief and a clear path forward.

By properly structuring transactions, implementing verification mechanisms, adding fallback systems, and aligning code with the actual database schema, we've significantly improved the reliability of batch processing while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase.

## Addendum: Supavisor Compatibility Fix (2025-04-02)

### Issue: Supavisor Compatibility in Batch Status Endpoint

During testing of the batch processing system, we discovered a deeper architectural issue with how sessions are created and managed in background tasks. The specific trigger was an error in the `get_batch_status_endpoint` function in `batch_page_scraper.py`, where the endpoint was improperly utilizing database parameters.

#### Problem

The `get_batch_status_endpoint` was including `db_params` as a dependency but not correctly utilizing these parameters for Supavisor compatibility. When calling the `get_batch_status` function, it wasn't passing the required execution options that ensure proper prepared statement handling with Supavisor.

#### Fix Implemented

1. Modified the `get_batch_status_endpoint` to properly use the session directly:

```python
@router.get("/batch/{batch_id}/status", response_model=BatchStatusResponse)
async def get_batch_status_endpoint(
    batch_id: str,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_dependency),  # Added session parameter
    current_user: Dict = Depends(user_dependency),
    db_params: Dict[str, Any] = Depends(get_db_params)  # Added db_params dependency
) -> BatchStatusResponse:
    # ... existing code ...

    # Router owns transaction boundary
    async with session.begin():
        # Get batch status with session parameter
        batch_status = await get_batch_status(
            session=session,  # Pass session to service
            batch_id=validated_batch_id,
            tenant_id=tenant_id
        )
```

This change ensures that the session is properly managed at the router level, following our architectural principle that "routers own transactions."

### Discovery of Deeper Architectural Issue

While fixing the immediate API endpoint issue, we discovered a more fundamental problem with the `process_batch_with_own_session` function. This background task was creating database sessions in a way that's incompatible with Supavisor:

1. **Direct Session Creation**: The function was using `async_session_factory()` directly instead of the proper `get_session()` context manager
2. **Missing Execution Options**: Without the context manager, critical Supavisor configuration parameters were missing
3. **Inconsistent Pattern**: Different background tasks across the codebase use different session creation patterns

This explains why background tasks were silently failing - they couldn't establish proper database connections due to Supavisor compatibility issues.

### Comprehensive Solution

To properly address this architectural issue, we've created a new work order (07-49-BACKGROUND-TASK-SUPAVISOR-STANDARDIZATION-WORK-ORDER) that:

1. Documents the proper pattern for background task session creation
2. Outlines the changes needed to standardize all background tasks
3. Provides a template for future implementations
4. Establishes a verification process to ensure compliance

This standardization effort will ensure all background tasks can successfully connect to the database through Supavisor, eliminating silent failures and ensuring consistent implementation across the codebase.

See [07-49-BACKGROUND-TASK-SUPAVISOR-STANDARDIZATION-WORK-ORDER.md](./07-49-BACKGROUND-TASK-SUPAVISOR-STANDARDIZATION-WORK-ORDER.md) for the detailed implementation plan.
