# Single Domain Scanner Optimization Summary

## Overview

The Single Domain Scanner has been successfully optimized to follow the isolated session pattern, eliminating the risk of `MissingGreenlet` errors. This document summarizes the changes made.

## Key Changes

1. **Refactored `process_domain_with_own_session`** in `src/services/page_scraper/domain_processor.py`:

   - Replaced single-session approach with discrete operations
   - Implemented proper error handling with dedicated sessions
   - Added Supavisor compatibility
   - Improved domain record management

2. **Created Helper Functions**:

   - `get_or_create_domain`: Handles domain lookup/creation with its own session
   - `update_job_status`: Updates job status with its own session
   - `update_job_with_results`: Updates completed job with its own session
   - `update_job_with_error`: Handles error status updates with its own session

3. **Fixed Router Implementation**:

   - Updated import path to use the correct module
   - Ensured tenant_id is properly passed to background tasks

4. **Added Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Unit tests for each helper function
   - Integration test for the full processing flow
   - Error handling test

## Pattern Implementation

Each database operation now follows this pattern:

```python
async def some_database_operation(param1, param2):
    """Perform a database operation with its own session."""
    try:
        async with get_background_session() as session:
            # Use text query with proper execution options for Supavisor compatibility
            query = text("""
                SQL QUERY HERE
            """).execution_options(prepared=False)

            result = await session.execute(query, {"param1": param1})
            # Process result as needed
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error message: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        raise  # Or handle appropriately
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Each database operation uses its own isolated session, preventing cascading failures
2. **Reliability**: Proper error handling with dedicated sessions for status updates
3. **Compatibility**: All SQL queries include Supavisor compatibility options
4. **Data Integrity**: No duplicate domain records
5. **Testability**: Modular design allows for comprehensive testing

## Documentation

Full implementation details can be found in:

- `docs/implementation/single-domain-scanner-optimization.md`
- Test file: `tests/test_single_domain_scanner.py`

## Next Steps

This pattern should be applied to other parts of the application:

1. Batch Domain Scanner
2. Sitemap Scanner
3. Other background processing functions
