# C.R.A.F.T. Prompt Engineering Guide

## Overview

The C.R.A.F.T. framework is designed to create highly effective prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). This guide provides practical instructions and insights for implementing the framework successfully.

## Key Benefits

- Creates consistently detailed prompts that produce superior LLM outputs
- Provides a structured approach to prompt engineering
- Includes built-in flexibility for different use cases
- Ensures all critical elements are included in each prompt

## How to Use the Framework

### General Workflow

1. Start with the base C.R.A.F.T. template
2. Input your specific topic/theme when requested
3. Review the generated prompt
4. Copy the generated prompt into a new chat
5. Get your final output

### Best Practices

#### Context Section

- Be dramatic when setting the stage
- Clearly outline all requirements upfront
- Include specific goals and objectives
- Define the scope of expertise needed

#### Role Section

- Always position the LLM as an expert
- Specify extensive experience (e.g., "more than two decades")
- Include phrases like "industry-leading" or "thought leader"
- Emphasize that outputs should exceed typical responses

#### Action Section

- Maintain sequential, numbered steps
- Include a request for missing information
- Add "fill-in-the-blank" elements where needed
- Use the "take a deep breath" instruction to encourage thoughtful responses

#### Format Section

- Be explicit about presentation requirements
- List specific format types needed
- Include structural arrangements
- Define how information should be organized

#### Target Audience Section

- Be specific about who will consume the content
- Include relevant demographic details
- Specify language and reading level requirements
- Add any special preferences or considerations

## Pro Tips

1. **Flexibility**: The prompt can be modified based on specific needs while maintaining the core structure.
2. **Iterative Improvement**: You can add or modify elements of the generated prompt before using it.
3. **Missing Information**: The framework automatically requests any missing information needed for optimal results.
4. **Format Adaptation**: The structure works across different LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.).

## Common Applications

- Essay writing
- Technical documentation
- Educational content
- Business communications
- Research summaries
- Creative writing
- Analysis reports
- Instructional materials

## Troubleshooting

- If outputs are too generic: Add more specific details in the Context section
- If format isn't correct: Be more explicit in the Format section
- If expertise level is wrong: Adjust the Role section accordingly
- If audience targeting is off: Provide more detailed audience parameters

## Best Results Checklist

- [ ] Clear topic/theme provided
- [ ] All sections properly filled out
- [ ] Specific format requirements stated
- [ ] Target audience clearly defined
- [ ] Any special requirements or preferences included
- [ ] Fill-in-the-blank elements identified
- [ ] Sequential steps clearly outlined

Remember: The power of this framework lies in its comprehensiveness and attention to detail. Take time to properly fill out each section for optimal results.
