# Background Task Scheduler

This directory contains technical documentation on changes made to the background task scheduler system in the ScraperSky backend.

## Contents

- `DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_MODERNIZATION.md` - Comprehensive technical document detailing the modernization of the domain processing scheduler

## Background

The ScraperSky backend relies on scheduled background tasks for processing domains, updating metadata, and performing maintenance operations. The APScheduler library is used to manage these scheduled tasks, which are initialized during application startup.

## Key Components

1. **Domain Scheduler** (`src/services/domain_scheduler.py`):

   - Processes pending domains in the background
   - Extracts metadata from websites
   - Updates domain records in the database

2. **FastAPI Integration** (`src/main.py`):
   - Initializes schedulers during application startup
   - Shuts down schedulers during application shutdown

## Changes Documentation

The `DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_MODERNIZATION.md` document provides excruciatingly detailed technical information about:

- Original implementation issues
- Code changes with before/after comparisons
- Technical implementation details
- Integration with FastAPI
- Testing and verification
- Recommendations for future updates

This documentation is intended for developers who need to understand, maintain, or extend the background task scheduling system.

## Usage Notes

1. The scheduler is automatically started when the FastAPI application starts
2. It runs in the background without any manual intervention
3. Logs provide information about scheduler status and domain processing

## Future Enhancements

The documentation includes recommendations for future enhancements, including:

- Migration to modern FastAPI lifespan events
- Additional performance metrics
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
