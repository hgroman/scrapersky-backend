# Domain Scheduler Revamp Work Order

## Executive Summary

**⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE: This work order contains several incorrect assumptions that led to unnecessary work. Please refer to the simplified [11.11-DOMAIN-SCHEDULER-REVISED-WORKORDER.md](./11.11-DOMAIN-SCHEDULER-REVISED-WORKORDER.md) document instead.**

This work order was based on incorrect assumptions about the code's architecture. The primary issue identified and fixed was actually much simpler: the Domain Scheduler was using raw SQL instead of the ORM methods already present in the Domain model. The fix required changing just a few lines of code to use Domain.update_from_metadata().

The following items in this work order were **NOT** needed:

- Domain Scheduler Refactoring: The scheduler was already correctly using the metadata extractor module
- Complete Database Insertion Test: This complex test script was unnecessary since the issue was using ORM vs raw SQL
- Most of the Enhanced Telemetry implementation: This was overly complex for actual needs

Only the "Configurable Scheduler Parameters" task was actually necessary and has been implemented.

- **Test Scripts**: `/scripts/check_real_domain.py`, `/scripts/add_real_domain.py`

## Actual Necessary Work Items

### 1. Domain Scheduler Refactoring - UNNECESSARY ❌

**⚠️ INCORRECT ASSUMPTION:** The original work order incorrectly assumed that the Domain Scheduler reimplemented functionality already present in `metadata_extractor.py`.

**ACTUAL FINDING:** The scheduler was already correctly importing and using the `detect_site_metadata()` function. The real issue was that it was using raw SQL queries to update the database instead of the ORM methods in the Domain model.

**CORRECT SOLUTION:** The fix required changing the database update code to use `Domain.update_from_metadata()` instead of raw SQL queries. This was a much simpler change than the extensive refactoring proposed here.

**LESSONS LEARNED:** This unnecessary work would have cost developers significant time implementing changes that weren't needed. Always verify assumptions about code duplication before proposing refactoring.

### 2. Configurable Scheduler Parameters (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - COMPLETED ✅

**Issue:** Scheduler parameters like interval and batch size should be configurable via settings.

**Required Changes:**

1. Add configuration options to `/src/config/settings.py`:

   - Add `DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default: 1)
   - Add `DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_BATCH_SIZE` (default: 10)
   - Add `DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_MAX_INSTANCES` (default: 1)

2. Update domain scheduler to use these settings
3. Document the available settings in README.md, .env.example, and docker-compose.yml

**Status:** This task has been implemented and completed on April 11, 2025.

### 3. Complete Database Insertion Test - UNNECESSARY ❌

**⚠️ INCORRECT ASSUMPTION:** The original work order incorrectly assumed that a complex database insertion test script was needed.

**ACTUAL FINDING:** Since the real issue was simply using ORM methods instead of raw SQL, this extensive test script was unnecessary. The existing test scripts (check_real_domain.py) were sufficient for verifying the fix.

**CORRECT SOLUTION:** A simple verification using the existing test tools was all that was needed.

**LESSONS LEARNED:** This would have created an overly complex test script based on the wrong assumptions, with functions duplicating what already existed in the Domain model's ORM methods.

### 4. Enhanced Telemetry and Monitoring (LOW PRIORITY) - SIMPLIFIED ⚠️

**Issue:** The scheduler lacks structured metrics for performance monitoring.

**⚠️ INCORRECT ASSUMPTION:** The original work order proposed an overly complex metrics system.

**REVISED APPROACH:** A simplified metrics implementation has been outlined in the 11.11 document, focusing only on essential metrics without introducing unnecessary complexity.

**Required Changes:**

1. Add a simple SchedulerMetrics class for collecting performance data
2. Modify the scheduler to track and record metrics
3. Implement metrics storage using ORM methods, not raw SQL

**Status:** This task is pending and is considered low priority.

## Implementation Plan

### Revised Plan

1. ✅ Use ORM Methods - COMPLETED

   - Replace raw SQL with Domain.update_from_metadata()
   - Fixed field key mismatches (email/phone vs emails/phones)

2. ✅ Configurable Scheduler Parameters - COMPLETED

   - Add settings to settings.py
   - Update scheduler to use these settings
   - Add documentation

3. ⏳ Enhanced Metrics (LOW PRIORITY) - PENDING
   - Implement simplified metrics collection
   - Focus on essential metrics only

## Technical Notes

The primary issue resolved in this project was much simpler than originally thought: using ORM methods instead of raw SQL. This follows the project's core architectural principle:

**NEVER USE RAW SQL IN APPLICATION CODE**

All database operations should use SQLAlchemy ORM methods, not raw SQL queries with text(). The only place "raw_sql=true" should appear is in connection configuration settings.
