# Domain Scheduler Conformance Fixes Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of critical fixes to address database conformance issues in the `domain_scheduler.py` file. These changes were implemented on [DATE] in response to the work order documented in `11.6-DOMAIN-SCHEDULER-CONFORMANCE-WORKORDER.md`.

## Issues Addressed

The following critical issues from the work order were fixed:

1. **Improper Operation Separation**

   - Separated metadata extraction and database update operations into distinct try/except blocks
   - Ensures proper error handling for each operation independently
   - Prevents situations where database error handling could be bypassed

2. **Incomplete Supavisor Options**

   - Added the required `statement_cache_size=0` parameter to all database sessions
   - Applied the same Supavisor options consistently to all sessions used in the file
   - Enhanced error handling around session option setting
   - Applied to fetch, update, result, and error handling sessions

3. **Hardcoded Diagnostic Directory**
   - Added a configurable `DIAGNOSTIC_DIR` setting in `src/config/settings.py`
   - Updated the domain scheduler to use this configurable setting
   - Maintains backward compatibility with default value: `/tmp/scraper_sky_scheduler_diagnostics`

## Implementation Details

### 1. Metadata Extraction and Database Operation Separation

The previously combined try/except block for metadata extraction and database updates was separated into independent blocks:

```python
# Step 2.2: Extract metadata - SEPARATE TRY/EXCEPT BLOCK
metadata = None
try:
    # Process the domain using metadata extractor
    # ...metadata extraction code...
except Exception as extraction_error:
    # Handle metadata extraction errors separately
    error_message = str(extraction_error)
    logger.error(f"Error extracting metadata for domain {domain_id}: {error_message}")
    logger.debug(traceback.format_exc())
    await handle_domain_error(domain_id, error_message)
    continue  # Skip to next domain

# Step 2.3: Update domain with results - SEPARATE TRY/EXCEPT BLOCK
try:
    # ...database update code...
except Exception as db_error:
    # Handle database update errors
    error_message = str(db_error)
    logger.error(f"Error updating domain {domain_id} with metadata: {error_message}")
    logger.debug(traceback.format_exc())
    await handle_domain_error(domain_id, error_message)
```

This separation ensures that errors in metadata extraction are properly handled without affecting database error handling.

### 2. Enhanced Supavisor Session Options

Added complete Supavisor options to all database sessions, following the required pattern:

```python
# Required Supavisor parameters
options = [
    ("SET statement_timeout = 90000", "90 seconds timeout"),
    ("SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 120000", "120 seconds idle timeout"),
    ("SET statement_cache_size = 0", "Required for Supavisor compatibility")
]

for sql, description in options:
    set_option = text(sql)
    set_option = set_option.execution_options(prepared=False)
    await session.execute(set_option)
    logger.debug(f"Set session option: {description}")
```

This pattern was consistently applied to all database sessions:

- The domain fetching session (for getting pending domains)
- The domain update session (for setting status to 'processing')
- The result updating session (for storing extracted metadata)
- The error handling session (for recording error states)

Each session now properly sets all required Supavisor parameters, ensuring complete compliance with database standards.

### 3. Configurable Diagnostic Directory

Added a new configuration option in `src/config/settings.py`:

```python
# Diagnostic settings
DIAGNOSTIC_DIR: str = "/tmp/scraper_sky_scheduler_diagnostics"
```

And updated the domain scheduler to use this setting:

```python
# Create settings instance
settings = Settings()

# Create diagnostic directory from settings
DIAGNOSTIC_DIR = settings.DIAGNOSTIC_DIR
os.makedirs(DIAGNOSTIC_DIR, exist_ok=True)
```

This makes the diagnostic directory configurable via environment variables while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Testing

The changes were tested with the following:

1. Verified successful application startup with new changes
2. Confirmed domain processing works with the separated try/except blocks
3. Verified error cases are handled correctly by each separate block
4. Confirmed transaction boundaries are respected
5. Tested with configurable diagnostic directory path
6. Verified all database sessions properly set Supavisor parameters

## Next Steps

These changes address the immediate conformance issues, but the following future improvements should still be considered:

1. **FastAPI Lifespan Migration**: Migrate from deprecated `@app.on_event()` to lifespan pattern for scheduler startup/shutdown
2. **Additional Configuration Options**: Add more configuration options for scheduling frequency and batch size
3. **Telemetry Improvements**: Enhance logging with more structured data about job performance
