# Work Order: Codebase Reference Cleanup for Renamed Page

**Date:** 2024-07-16
**Assignee:** AI Assistant / Developer
**Parent Work Order:** `project-docs/28-CLEAN-UP-Pre-Render/28.3-Post-MVP-Page-Rename-Tasks.md` (Task 4)
**Related Files:** Entire codebase (`/src`, `/static`, `/tests`, `/scripts`, `/Docs`, etc.)

## 1. Objective

To locate and update any remaining hardcoded references (in code, comments, documentation, or configuration files) to the old static interface filename `google-maps.html`, replacing them with the new filename `scraper-sky-mvp.html` to ensure codebase consistency and maintainability.

## 2. Workflow Steps

1.  **Define Search Scope:**

    - **Action:** Determine the relevant directories for the search.
    - **Scope:** `/src`, `/static` (including `/js`, `/shared`, etc.), `/tests`, `/scripts`, `/Docs`, configuration files (e.g., `render.yaml`).

2.  **Perform Codebase Search:**

    - **Action:** Use codebase search tools (e.g., `grep`, IDE search) to find all occurrences of the exact string `"google-maps.html"`.
    - **Output:** A list of files and line numbers containing the target string.

3.  **Analyze Search Results:**

    - **Action:** Review each occurrence found in Step 2.
    - **Assessment:** Determine the context of each reference:
      - Is it a functional link or path used in code (HTML `href`, JS fetch/redirect, Python file path)?
      - Is it within a code comment?
      - Is it within a documentation file (`.md`)?
      - Is it part of a backup file name (which should have been handled by WO 33.1)?

4.  **Plan Remediation:**

    - **Action:** For each relevant occurrence (excluding those in already identified backup/deleted files), plan the necessary update.
    - **Focus:** Typically, replace `"google-maps.html"` with `"scraper-sky-mvp.html"`. If the reference is in a comment or documentation that is no longer accurate due to the rename, update the surrounding text for clarity.
    - **Output:** A list of files and the specific changes required for each.

5.  **Propose and Apply Edits:**

    - **Action:** Implement the planned changes via code/file edits. Apply edits carefully, ensuring surrounding code logic remains intact.
    - **Output:** Modified files with updated references.

6.  **Verification Search:**
    - **Action:** Re-run the codebase search from Step 2.
    - **Output:** Confirmation that no remaining functional or misleading references to `"google-maps.html"` exist (excluding potentially necessary mentions in historical documentation like work orders).

## 3. Completion Criteria

- A codebase-wide search for `"google-maps.html"` has been performed across the defined scope.
- All identified functional references and misleading comments/documentation mentions have been updated to use `scraper-sky-mvp.html` or reflect the change accurately.
- A verification search confirms the removal of outdated references.
