7. **Database Consolidation Summary** (01:11) - Summary of changes and benefits
8. **Database Pattern Test Plan** (01:27) - Test plan for verifying correct implementation

## Phase 6: Completion Planning and Cleanup (March 24, 2025)

As the major consolidation efforts neared completion, focus shifted to final cleanup and verification.

1. **Master Reference** (08:32) - Comprehensive reference for the entire project

3. **Progress Tracker** (08:19) - Updated tracking of implementation progress
4. **Consolidation Completion Summary** (08:33) - Overview of the completed consolidation effort

## Phase 7: API Standardization (March 24, 2025)

The API routes were standardized to version 3 (v3) with consistent patterns.

1. **API Standardization** (09:55) - Implementation report for API standardization

## Phase 8: Implementation Completion (March 24, 2025)

Final steps to complete the implementation and document reality vs. goals.

1. **Reality Completion Plan** (10:45) - Assessment of current reality and plan for completion
2. **Implementation Progress** (10:45) - Final progress tracking

## Phase 9: Error Fix (March 24, 2025)

A specific issue with FastAPI endpoint signatures was identified and fixed.

1. **FastAPI Endpoint Signatures Fix** (11:19) - Fix for preserving proper function signatures with error wrappers

## Phase 10: Tenant Isolation Removal (March 24, 2025)

The final phase removed the multi-tenant isolation mechanisms to simplify the codebase.

1. **Tenant Checks Removal** (12:35) - Implementation plan for removing tenant isolation checks

## Phase 11: Database Schema Type Fix (March 25, 2025)

A critical issue with database schema type mismatches was identified and fixed.

1. **Database Connection Audit** (15:12) - Comprehensive audit of database connection patterns
2. **Enhanced Database Connection Plan** (16:48) - Plan for improving database connections
3. **Database Schema Type Fix** (19:57) - Critical fix for type mismatches in UUID fields
4. **Job ID Generation Standardization** (20:15) - Plan to standardize job_id generation to use proper UUIDs

## Phase 12: Authentication Boundary Implementation (March 25, 2025)

- Formalization of authentication boundary as a CRITICAL principle
- Creation of detailed documentation on JWT authentication at router level only
- Implementation of code patterns demonstrating correct authentication flow
- Updates to AI Guides to explicitly enforce this principle
- Review of existing code for compliance

## Future Phases (Planned for 2025-03-26+)

1. **UUID Standardization**

   - Converting all job_id fields to proper UUID format
   - Updating job service for standard UUID handling
   - Standardizing Domain Service UUID patterns

2. **Testing Framework Implementation**

   - Completion of Google Maps API testing script
   - Development of additional service test scripts
   - Implementation of transaction boundary tests

3. **Final Standardization**

   - Job Service standardization
   - Domain Service review and update
   - Core Services standardization
   - Error handling improvements

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Connection pooling fine-tuning
   - Query optimization
   - Transaction boundary refinement

## Critical Decisions

- **Transaction Ownership**: Routers own transactions, services are transaction-aware
- **Session Management**: Dependency injection for sessions, proper session lifecycle
- **Authentication Boundary**: JWT authentication ONLY at API router level, never in services
- **UUID Standardization**: All UUIDs must be proper PostgreSQL UUIDs, no custom formats
