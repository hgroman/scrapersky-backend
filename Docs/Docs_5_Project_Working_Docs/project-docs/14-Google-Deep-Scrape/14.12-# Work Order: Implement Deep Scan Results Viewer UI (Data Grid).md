# Work Order: Implement Deep Scan Results Viewer UI (Data Grid)

**Document ID:** 14.12-Results-Viewer-UI-Data-Grid
**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2023-04-03
**Author:** AI Assistant (Gemini)

## 1. Objective

To implement a user-friendly data grid interface within `static/google-maps.html` that allows users to browse and view the detailed business information stored in the `local_businesses` table. This UI will serve as the final destination to view the results of successful Curation-Driven Deep Scans.

## 2. Scope & Requirements

Create a new tab and panel within `static/google-maps.html`, leveraging the existing structure and styling:

1.  **UI Elements (New "Results Viewer" Panel):**

    - Add a new tab labeled "Results Viewer" alongside "Single Search", "Staging Editor", etc.
    - Create a corresponding panel (`id="resultsViewerPanel"`) for the tab content.
    - **(Placeholder) Filter Controls:** Add a placeholder area for potential future filter controls (e.g., search box for Business Name/Address, Date Range). Initially, data will be fetched without specific filters, ordered by update time.
    - **Data Grid Table:** Implement a table (`id="resultsTable"`) to display fetched `local_businesses` records. Include relevant columns such as:
      - Business Name (`data-field="name"`)
      - Address (`data-field="formatted_address"`)
      - Phone (`data-field="phone"`)
      - Website (`data-field="website_url"`)
      - Main Category (`data-field="main_category"`)
      - Rating (`data-field="rating"`)
      - Reviews Count (`data-field="reviews_count"`)
      - Deep Scan Timestamp (`data-field="updated_at"` or similar field indicating when the deep scan data was saved/updated)
      - Place ID (`data-field="place_id"`, potentially hidden but available)
    - **Pagination Controls:** Basic pagination controls similar to the Staging Editor (e.g., Previous/Next buttons, page info display: `id="resultsPaginationInfo"`, `id="resultsPrevBtn"`, `id="resultsNextBtn"`).

2.  **JavaScript Logic:**

    - **Data Fetching (`fetchResultsData`):**
      - Implement a function to fetch data from a **new backend listing endpoint** for `local_businesses`. **ASSUMPTION:** This endpoint needs to be created (e.g., `GET /api/v3/local-businesses/`).
      - The function should handle pagination (`page`, `size` parameters) and default ordering (e.g., by `updated_at DESC`).
      - Requires a valid JWT token.
      - Handle API success and error responses gracefully.
    - **Rendering (`renderResultsTable`):** Populate the `#resultsTable` with fetched data and update pagination controls (`#resultsPaginationInfo`, button states). Reuse/adapt logic from `renderStagingTable` where applicable.
    - **Event Listeners:** Attach appropriate event listeners for tab activation (to trigger initial data fetch), and pagination buttons.

3.  **Styling:**
    - Ensure the new tab, panel, table, and controls adhere strictly to the existing dark theme, colors, and visual style of `google-maps.html`.

## 3. Backend Dependency Assumption

- This implementation **relies heavily on the creation of a new backend API endpoint** (e.g., `GET /api/v3/local-businesses/`) capable of returning a paginated list of `local_businesses` records, potentially with filtering and sorting options in the future. This endpoint needs its own router (`local_businesses.py`) and inclusion in `main.py`.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- A new "Results Viewer" tab is present and functional.
- On tab activation, data is fetched from the new backend endpoint (once created) and displayed in the `#resultsTable`.
- Pagination controls function correctly for the results data.
- The visual style is consistent with the rest of the page.
- Functionality of other tabs remains unaffected.

## 5. Implementation Notes

- Development should pattern closely after the "Staging Editor" implementation (`14.11-Staging-Editor-UI-Data-Grid.md`), reusing HTML structure, CSS classes, and adapting JavaScript functions (`fetchStagingData` -> `fetchResultsData`, `renderStagingTable` -> `renderResultsTable`, etc.).
- Requires significant backend work to create the necessary API endpoint (`GET /api/v3/local-businesses/`) including a new router file, ORM query logic (against `LocalBusiness` model), Pydantic response models, and inclusion in the main FastAPI app.
