   - Added explicit transaction boundaries to all endpoints
   - Background tasks were already correctly creating their own sessions
   - Already passing session parameters to service methods
   - Had good error handling with appropriate exception propagation

10. ✅ `src/routers/modernized_page_scraper.py`
   - Updated to use `get_session_dependency` instead of `get_db_session`
   - Added transaction boundaries to all endpoints 
   - Fixed missing session parameters in service calls
   - Removed incorrect comments about transaction management
   - Fixed inconsistent service method parameters

11. ✅ `src/routers/profile.py`
   - Updated to use `get_session_dependency` instead of `get_db_session`
   - Transaction boundaries were already correctly implemented
   - Added missing CRUD endpoints for complete API functionality 
   - All service methods were already correctly receiving session parameters
   - Had proper error handling with appropriate exception propagation

## Project Completion

All files have been successfully updated to follow our standardized database access patterns.

## Next Steps

1. Create test cases for each updated file to verify:
   - Transaction boundaries are properly managed
   - Error handling correctly triggers rollbacks
   - Background tasks properly create and manage their own sessions

2. Document the standardized patterns in a centralized README for other developers

3. Consider creating a pre-commit hook to check for compliance with database access patterns

4. Archive old database connection files that are no longer used:
   - Move src/db/session.py to archive/db/session.py
   - Move other deprecated modules to appropriate archive locations

5. Update any remaining imports in the codebase that might still reference the old modules

## Key Patterns Established

1. **Router owns transaction boundaries**:
   ```python
   @router.get("/example")
   async def get_example(session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_dependency)):
       async with session.begin():
           # Call transaction-aware service
           result = await service.get_example(session=session)
       return result
   ```

2. **Service methods are transaction-aware**:
   ```python
   async def get_example(session: AsyncSession, param: str):
       # Service accepts session but doesn't manage transaction
       result = await session.execute(
           text("SELECT * FROM examples WHERE id = :id"),
           {"id": param}
       )
       return result.fetchone()
   ```

3. **Background tasks manage their own sessions**:
   ```python
   async def background_task(data: dict):
       # Create dedicated session for background task
       session = async_session_factory()
       try:
           async with session.begin():
               # Perform database operations
               await session.execute(...)
       finally:
           await session.close()
   ```
