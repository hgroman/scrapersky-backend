## 1. Overview

This document details the investigation into HTTP 500 errors affecting the "Local Business Curation" and "Domain Curation" UI tabs and outlines the necessary cleanup work required to remove legacy user tracking artifacts discovered during the debugging process. While the immediate cause of the 500 errors was resolved, further cleanup is needed to align the codebase with the established architecture (no RBAC, no user tracking).

## 2. Problem Description

Users reported consistent HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors when attempting to load data in the "Local Business Curation" (`/api/v3/local-businesses`) and "Domain Curation" (`/api/v3/domains`) tabs within the application frontend. This occurred despite the `scrapersky` service reporting as healthy after restarts.

## 3. Investigation Steps & Findings

The investigation proceeded through the following steps:

1.  **Router Configuration Check:** Reviewed `src/main.py` and the specific router files (`src/routers/local_businesses.py`, `src/routers/domains.py`). Found that router prefix definitions and inclusions were consistent with project conventions for these specific endpoints. Ruled out simple routing misconfiguration as the primary cause.
2.  **Error Reproduction & Traceback 1:** Triggered the error for `/api/v3/local-businesses` via `curl`. Captured the following traceback in the logs:
    ```
    sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Mapper 'Mapper[Domain(domains)]' has no property 'sitemap_files'. If this property was indicated from other mappers or configure events, ensure registry.configure() has been called.
    ```
    This indicated a missing `relationship` definition on the `Domain` model (`src/models/domain.py`) required by a `back_populates` argument on the `SitemapFile` model.
3.  **Fix Attempt 1:** Added the required `sitemap_files = relationship("SitemapFile", back_populates="domain", ...)` definition to `src/models/domain.py`.
4.  **Traceback 2 (Post-Fix 1):** Restarted the service. The error persisted, but the traceback changed, now appearing during application startup (specifically within scheduler logs):
    ```
    sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: One or more mappers failed to initialize... Triggering mapper: 'Mapper[SitemapFile(sitemap_files)]'. Original exception was: When initializing mapper Mapper[SitemapFile(sitemap_files)], expression 'src.models.user.User' failed to locate a name...
    ```
    This indicated the `SitemapFile` model contained relationships (`creator`, `updater`) pointing to an invalid path (`src.models.user.User`).
5.  **Fix Attempt 2:** Corrected the relationship paths in `src/models/sitemap_file.py` from `"src.models.user.User"` to the relative `"User"`.
6.  **Traceback 3 (Post-Fix 2):** Restarted the service. The error still persisted during startup with a similar traceback:
    ```
    sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: One or more mappers failed to initialize... Triggering mapper: 'Mapper[SitemapFile(sitemap_files)]'. Original exception was: When initializing mapper Mapper[SitemapFile(sitemap_files)], expression 'User' failed to locate a name ('User')...
    ```
    This confirmed the issue was not just the path string, but that SQLAlchemy could not find a _mapped database entity_ named `User`.
7.  **Root Cause Identification:** Examination of `src/models/user.py` revealed it defined a **Pydantic** `BaseModel` named `User`, not a SQLAlchemy `Base`-derived model. The relationships (`creator`, `updater`) and associated foreign key columns (`created_by`, `updated_by`) within `src/models/sitemap_file.py` were identified as incorrect artifacts. These fields were added during recent debugging efforts (documented in `project-docs/22-Google-Static-Page-Tab-and-Java-Audit/22.5-Train-Wreck.md`) and directly violated the project mandate to remove all user tracking.

## 4. Fix Implemented (Immediate 500 Error Blocker)

To resolve the immediate SQLAlchemy initialization failure and the resulting 500 errors on the UI tabs, the following changes were made:

- **Removed Columns:** The `created_by` and `updated_by` column definitions were removed from the `SitemapFile` class in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.
- **Removed Relationships:** The `creator` and `updater` relationship definitions were removed from the `SitemapFile` class in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.

Following these changes and a service restart (`docker-compose restart scrapersky`), startup logs were clean, indicating the SQLAlchemy initialization error was resolved. The original 500 errors impacting the UI tabs are confirmed fixed.

## 5. Further Findings (Legacy User Tracking Artifacts)

During the investigation, an audit of other SQLAlchemy models revealed remaining legacy user tracking fields, inconsistent with the removal of RBAC and user tracking:

- **`src/models/domain.py`:** Contains a `created_by = Column(PGUUID)` field and accepts `created_by` in `create_from_metadata`.
- **`src/models/place.py`:** Contains `created_by`, `user_id`, `user_name`, and `updated_by` columns.
- **`src/models/job.py`:** Contains a `created_by = Column(PGUUID)` field and accepts `created_by` in `create_for_domain`.
- **`src/models/batch_job.py`:** Contains a `created_by = Column(PGUUID)` field and accepts `created_by` in `create_new_batch`.

Furthermore, `grep` searches confirmed that these legacy attributes are still accessed or used as parameters in numerous files within the `src/routers` and `src/services` directories, including (but not limited to):

- `src/services/places/places_storage_service.py`
- `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`
- `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py`
- `src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py`
- (See `grep` output in conversation history for the full list)

## 6. Scope Creep Avoidance

Addressing the legacy user tracking artifacts identified in section 5 was explicitly deferred to avoid scope creep beyond fixing the immediate 500 errors affecting the UI tabs. These artifacts did not cause the final initialization error.

## 7. Required Action: Legacy User Tracking Cleanup

A dedicated effort is required to fully remove the remaining legacy user tracking artifacts and align the codebase with the architectural decision to eliminate user tracking:

1.  **Model Column Removal:** Remove the identified legacy columns (`created_by`, `user_id`, `user_name`, `updated_by`) from the SQLAlchemy model definitions in `src/models/domain.py`, `src/models/place.py`, `src/models/job.py`, and `src/models/batch_job.py`.
2.  **Code Usage Removal:** Systematically review the code identified by the `grep` search (and potentially perform wider searches) in routers and services. Remove all code that reads, writes, or passes these legacy attributes as parameters for the affected models.
3.  **Database Schema Audit (Recommended):** Verify that the corresponding columns (`created_by`, `user_id`, `user_name`, `updated_by`) do not exist in the actual database tables (`domains`, `places_staging`, `jobs`, `batch_jobs`). If they exist, create and apply an Alembic migration to `DROP` these columns.
4.  **Pydantic User Model Relocation (Recommended):** Move the Pydantic `User` model from `src/models/user.py` to a more appropriate location (e.g., `src/auth/schemas.py`) and consider renaming it (e.g., `UserTokenData`) to avoid confusion with database models.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test application functionality after the cleanup, particularly the areas where code was modified (e.g., job creation, place storage, batch processing).

This cleanup will remove technical debt and ensure the codebase accurately reflects the intended architecture.
