# JavaScript Refactoring Plan: google-maps.html Tabs

**Objective:** Isolate tab-specific JavaScript logic from the main inline `<script>` in `static/google-maps.html` into dedicated external files (`/static/js/[tab-name]-tab.js`) for improved modularity, following the pattern established for the Domain Curation tab.

**Target Tabs for Refactoring:**

Based on `22.1-Google-Maps-Tab-Architecture-with-ORM.md`, the tabs requiring this refactoring are:

1.  Single Search (`data-panel="singleSearch"`)
2.  Staging Editor (`data-panel="stagingEditor"`)
3.  Local Business Curation (`data-panel="localBusinessCuration"`)
4.  Batch Search (`data-panel="batchSearch"`) - _Note: Functionality might be less complete based on original comments._
5.  Results Viewer (`data-panel="resultsViewer"`) - _Note: Uses older endpoints, logic might differ._

**Phase 1: Audit Process (For Each Target Tab)**

1.  **Locate Inline Code:**
    - Open `static/google-maps.html`.
    - Search within the main `<script>` block (near the end of the file) for code related to the specific tab. Look for:
      - Variable declarations referencing the tab's specific HTML element IDs (e.g., `singleSearchForm`, `stagingTableBody`, `localBusinessPrevBtn`, `batchSearchStatus`, `resultsViewerTable`).
      - Function definitions clearly associated with the tab's functionality (e.g., `fetchStagingData`, `renderLocalBusinessTable`, `startBatchSearch`).
      - Event listeners attached to elements _within_ the tab's panel (e.g., filter buttons, pagination controls, batch update buttons for that specific tab).
      - Comments indicating sections related to the tab (e.g., `// Staging Editor Logic`).
2.  **Identify Activation Trigger:**
    - Determine how the initial data fetch or setup function (e.g., `fetchStagingData(1)`) is currently called for this tab. Is it:
      - Within the main tab-switching `if/else if` block that handles adding `tab-active`?
      - Via a dedicated event listener attached directly to the tab element (`.tab[data-panel='...']`) within the inline script?
      - Triggered by some other means?
    - _This is crucial for ensuring the refactored code includes the correct self-activation mechanism._
3.  **Note Dependencies:**
    - Identify any reliance on shared utility functions (e.g., `getJwtToken()`, `showStatus()`) defined elsewhere in the inline script or globally.
    - Note any global variables the tab logic might read from or write to.
4.  **Check for Existing External Files:**
    - Verify if a `/static/js/[tab-name]-tab.js` file already exists for the tab. If so, examine its contents â€“ is it empty, partially used, or does it already contain relevant logic?

---

**Phase 2: Work Order / Refactoring Steps (Perform Sequentially for Each Target Tab)**

1.  **Create External File:**
    - Create a new file named `/static/js/[tab-name]-tab.js` (e.g., `staging-editor-tab.js`, `local-business-curation-tab.js`).
2.  **Move JavaScript Logic:**
    - Carefully select and cut the identified tab-specific JavaScript code (variable declarations, functions, internal event listeners) from the inline `<script>` in `static/google-maps.html`.
    - Paste this code into the newly created external file.
    - Wrap the entire pasted code block within `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { ... });` to ensure the DOM is ready before the code executes.
3.  **Implement Self-Contained Activation:**
    - Inside the new external file (within the `DOMContentLoaded` listener), add an event listener specifically for the tab element (`document.querySelector('.tab[data-panel="[tab-name]"]')`).
    - This listener should check if the tab becomes active (e.g., by checking for the `tab-active` class, possibly using a brief `setTimeout` as done for Domain Curation) and then call the primary data-fetching/initialization function for that tab (e.g., `fetchStagingData(1)`).
4.  **Link External File:**
    - In `static/google-maps.html`, add a `<script>` tag to include the new external file, using the `defer` attribute. Place it near the other external script includes (like `domain-curation-tab.js`).
    - Example: `<script src="/static/js/staging-editor-tab.js" defer></script>`
5.  **Handle Dependencies:**
    - Ensure any shared utility functions (`getJwtToken`, `showStatus`, etc.) relied upon by the moved code are accessible. If they are defined globally in the remaining inline script and the external script uses `defer`, they _should_ be available. Verify this during testing. If issues arise, consider moving shared utilities to a dedicated `utils.js` file included _before_ the tab-specific scripts.
6.  **Clean Up Inline Script:**
    - Remove the now-empty code block (or the code that was moved) from the inline script in `static/google-maps.html`.
    - Add a clear comment indicating that the logic for `[Tab Name]` has been moved to its external file (e.g., `// === Staging Editor Logic Moved to /static/js/staging-editor-tab.js ===`).
    - **Crucially:** Do _not_ remove the core tab-switching logic (the part that adds/removes `tab-active` and `panel-active` classes) unless a full refactoring of that mechanism is intended.
7.  **Test Thoroughly:**
    - Restart the server.
    - Clear browser cache and reload `google-maps.html`.
    - Test the refactored tab extensively:
      - Does it load data correctly when first clicked?
      - Do filters work?
      - Does pagination work?
      - Does selection (single/all) work?
      - Do batch actions work?
      - Are there any errors in the browser's developer console?
      - Does switching _away_ from the tab and back still work correctly?
8.  **Commit Changes:** Once a single tab is successfully refactored and tested, commit the changes before proceeding to the next tab.

**Recommendation:** Perform this refactoring one tab at a time to minimize risk and make troubleshooting easier. Start with a tab that has relatively well-defined functionality based on the audit (e.g., "Staging Editor" or "Local Business Curation" might be good candidates).
