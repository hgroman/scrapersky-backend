# Handover: Debugging 500 Errors on Curation Tabs - RESOLVED

**Document ID:** ~~22.5-Train-Wreck~~ **23.2-Train-Wreck-Resolved**
**Status:** ~~Handover - Debugging Required~~ **Resolved**
**Created:** April 11, 2025
**Author:** Gemini Assistant (Previous & Current)

## 1. Overview

This document details the debugging steps taken attempting to resolve API issues, culminating in a state where the backend service (`scrapersky`) restarts and reports as healthy, but specific UI tabs ("Local Business Curation", "Domain Curation") consistently failed with HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors when attempting to load data. **The root cause was ultimately traced to an incorrect SQLAlchemy model relationship introduced during recent debugging, not router conflicts.**

~~The user suspects an issue within `src/main.py`, potentially related to how API routers are included and interfering with each other, despite previous checks suggesting adherence to the project's prefix convention (`Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/23-FASTAPI_ROUTER_PREFIX_CONVENTION.md`).~~ **Note:** The initial hypothesis regarding router conflicts in `src/main.py` proved incorrect. Routing configuration for the affected endpoints was verified as correct.

**Explicit Instruction:** The previous assistant is forbidden from making further code changes.

## 2. Initial Problem & Context (Resolved)

The debugging session began with a `404 Not Found` error when trying to `PUT` an update to `/api/sitemap-files/{id}`. This was traced through several steps:

1.  **Incorrect API Path:** The initial `curl` command was missing `/v3/`. Correcting the path to `/api/v3/sitemap-files/{id}` resolved the immediate routing 404.
2.  **Missing Pydantic Field:** The request then resulted in a `400 Bad Request` ("No update data provided.") because the `SitemapFileUpdate` Pydantic model (`src/schemas/sitemap_file.py`) was missing the `deep_scrape_curation_status` field being sent in the payload. This field was added to the model.
3.  **Persistent 404 (Model Layer):** The request then reverted to a `404 Not Found`, originating from the service layer (`sitemap_files_service.update`) because the underlying model method (`SitemapFile.get_by_id`) was returning `None`, despite database checks confirming the record existed. Debug logs added to the service/model layer were not appearing.

## 3. SQLAlchemy Initialization Error Branch (Initial Fix Attempts)

The investigation then uncovered a critical SQLAlchemy error happening during application startup, visible in the logs _before_ the 404s from the API test occurred:

```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: One or more mappers failed to initialize - can't proceed with initialization of other mappers. Triggering mapper: 'Mapper[SitemapFile(sitemap_files)]'. Original exception was: Multiple classes found for path "SitemapFile" in the registry of this declarative base. Please use a fully module-qualified path.
```

This indicated that the `SitemapFile` model class was being registered multiple times by SQLAlchemy's declarative system, likely preventing proper database interaction and causing `session.get()` to fail unexpectedly.

**Resolution Steps Taken for Initial SQLAlchemy Error:**

1.  **Fully Qualified Relationship Paths:** Updated `relationship()` definitions in `src/models/sitemap_file.py` to use fully qualified paths (e.g., `"src.models.user.User"`). This addressed the error message's suggestion but not the root cause.
2.  **Identified Conflicting Import:** Found that `src/models/__init__.py` was incorrectly importing `SitemapFile` and `SitemapUrl` from a non-existent/conflicting `src/models/sitemap.py` file, while the correct definitions were in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.
3.  **Deleted Conflicting File:** Deleted `src/models/sitemap.py`.
4.  **Corrected `__init__.py` Import:** Changed the import in `src/models/__init__.py` to `from .sitemap_file import SitemapFile, SitemapUrl`.
5.  **Linter Error & Missing Model:** This revealed that `SitemapUrl` was _not_ defined in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`. Grep confirmed `SitemapUrl` was necessary.
6.  **Defined `SitemapUrl`:** Added a basic SQLAlchemy definition for the `SitemapUrl` model (based on inferred schema) into `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.
7.  **Fixed Imports in Services/Migrations:** Corrected import statements in multiple service files (`sitemap_scheduler`, `background_service`, `processing_service`, `sitemap_service`, `analyzer_service`) and `migrations/env.py` that were still pointing to the deleted `src.models.sitemap` path, changing them to `src.models.sitemap_file`. Several minor linter errors related to these edits were also addressed.

## 4. Current Problem & State (During Debugging)

- **Service Health:** After the import fixes, `docker-compose restart scrapersky` succeeded, and `docker-compose ps` shows the service as `(healthy)`. This _suggested_ the initial SQLAlchemy initialization error ("Multiple classes found") was resolved, **but a different initialization error persisted.**
- **UI Errors:** Despite the healthy service status, the user reports (with screenshots) that loading the "Local Business Curation" and "Domain Curation" tabs results in **HTTP 500 Internal Server Errors**. These errors appear both in the general error message area and within the data table ("Error loading data: ...").
- **User Hypothesis:** The user strongly suspects that changes made, particularly the model restructuring or potentially subtle issues in `src/main.py`'s router inclusion, are causing interference between the endpoints serving these tabs. **Note: This hypothesis was incorrect.** The issue was related to model definitions, not router inclusion.

## 4.5 Actual Root Cause and Resolution

Further investigation revealed the persistent 500 errors were caused by a **new SQLAlchemy initialization error** introduced during the "Resolution Steps Taken for Initial SQLAlchemy Error" (specifically Step 1 and/or Step 6):

- **Incorrect Relationship:** The `SitemapFile` model definition in `src/models/sitemap_file.py` included `created_by` / `updated_by` columns and `creator` / `updater` relationships pointing to a `User` model. This addition violated the project's mandate to remove all RBAC and user tracking.
- **Missing SQLAlchemy User Model:** The relationships failed because `src/models/user.py` defined a Pydantic `User` model, not a SQLAlchemy database model. SQLAlchemy could not find the expected mapped entity named "User", causing the `InvalidRequestError: ... expression 'User' failed to locate a name ('User')...` during mapper initialization.
- **Impact:** This initialization failure prevented models related to `SitemapFile` (including `Domain`) from being configured correctly, leading to the 500 errors when the affected API endpoints (`/api/v3/local-businesses`, `/api/v3/domains`) attempted database operations.

**Fix Applied:**

1.  **Removed Invalid Fields:** The incorrect `created_by` and `updated_by` columns were removed from the `SitemapFile` model definition in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.
2.  **Removed Invalid Relationships:** The incorrect `creator` and `updater` relationships were removed from the `SitemapFile` model definition.
3.  **Verification:** After restarting the `scrapersky` service, startup logs were clean, and the 500 errors on the "Local Business Curation" and "Domain Curation" tabs were confirmed resolved.

**Note:** Additional legacy user tracking fields were found in other models (`Domain`, `Place`, `Job`, `BatchJob`) and their usage in services/routers. These were _not_ the cause of the immediate 500 error and cleanup has been deferred to a separate work order (`project-docs/24-Audit and Remove Legacy User Tracking Fields/24.1-Work-Order.md`) to avoid scope creep.

## 5. Recommended Next Steps for Investigation (Original - Now Obsolete/Modified)

**Note:** The following steps were recommended based on the incorrect hypothesis that router conflicts or general model issues were the cause. The actual resolution path followed Step 1 (verifying logs, which revealed the persistent initialization error) and then focused on debugging the specific `InvalidRequestError` related to the `SitemapFile` and `User` models.

1.  **Verify SQLAlchemy Initialization:** ~~Double-check the startup logs immediately after a `docker-compose restart scrapersky` _very carefully_ to be 100% certain that no SQLAlchemy initialization errors (like the "Multiple classes found" or others) are still occurring, even if the final health check passes.~~ **Done. This revealed the persistent `InvalidRequestError: ... expression 'User' failed to locate a name ('User')...`**
2.  **Examine `main.py` Router Inclusion:** ~~...~~ **Obsolete.** Router inclusion was correct for the affected endpoints.
3.  **Analyze Runtime Logs During UI Request:** ~~...~~ **Obsolete.** The error occurred during startup/initialization, not just during specific UI requests, although requests triggered the manifestation of the underlying issue.
4.  **Debug Failing Endpoints:** ~~...~~ **Obsolete.** Endpoint logic was not the primary issue; the problem was the underlying model configuration failure.
5.  **Consider Model Definitions:** ~~Review the newly added `SitemapUrl` definition in `src/models/sitemap_file.py`. Is it complete? Does it correctly define relationships needed by other parts of the application? Although it fixed the import error, could its _structure_ cause issues during queries involving related models?~~ **Partially relevant.** The structure of `SitemapFile` _was_ the issue, specifically the erroneously added `User` relationships, not the `SitemapUrl` definition itself.
