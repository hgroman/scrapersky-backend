# Handover Note: Local Business to Domain Workflow Completion

**Date:** April 7, 2025
**From:** Previous Gemini Assistant
**To:** Next AI Assistant

**Context:** This note summarizes the progress and remaining tasks for implementing the workflow where users select `local_businesses` records, triggering the creation of corresponding `pending` records in the `domains` table. The user has requested a handover due to concerns about potential context window limitations observed in the previous assistant.

**Goal:** Enable you to efficiently pick up and complete the remaining work, primarily focused on the frontend implementation and final backend testing.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS ⚠️**

- **Read `README.md`:** Before diving into the specifics below, **thoroughly review the project's `README.md`**. It contains critical setup instructions, non-negotiable architectural requirements (like the ORM mandate), standard tooling (`docker-compose`, `pytest`, DB scripts), and links to essential documentation.
- **Understand Core Principles:** Familiarize yourself with the core principles outlined in the AI Guides (`Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/`), especially the **Absolute ORM Requirement** – NEVER use raw SQL.
- **Setup Environment:** Use `docker-compose up -d` as described in the `README.md` to start the development environment.

## I. Completed Work

The core backend infrastructure for this workflow is **complete** and largely tested.

1.  **Backend Implementation:**

    - All necessary database schema changes (new enum `DomainExtractionStatusEnum`, columns `status`, `domain_extraction_status`, `domain_extraction_error` in `local_businesses`; column `local_business_id` with FK in `domains`) have been applied.
    - SQLAlchemy models (`LocalBusiness`, `Domain`) have been updated.
    - Required Pydantic API models (`LocalBusinessApiStatusEnum`, `LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest`) are defined in `src/models/api_models.py`.
    - The worker service `LocalBusinessToDomainService` (`src/services/business_to_domain_service.py`) is implemented. It handles fetching the business, extracting the domain from `website_url`, checking for duplicates in the `domains` table, and creating a new `pending` domain record with the correct foreign key if the domain is new. It correctly handles cases with no `website_url` and existing domains.
    - The API router `src/routers/local_businesses.py` is created with the `PUT /status` endpoint. This endpoint correctly maps API status enums to DB enums, updates the `local_businesses.status`, and conditionally sets `local_businesses.domain_extraction_status` to `queued` when the status is set to `Selected`.
    - The main scheduler (`src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`) has been successfully modified to query for and process `local_businesses` with `domain_extraction_status = 'queued'`, invoking the `LocalBusinessToDomainService`. It handles updating the status to `processing`, `completed`, or `failed` based on the service outcome.
    - The new router (`local_businesses_api_router`) is correctly registered in `src/main.py`.

2.  **Backend Testing (Partial):**

    - **Happy Path:** Verified end-to-end. Setting a `LocalBusiness` status to `Selected` via the API correctly queues it, the scheduler picks it up, the service creates a `pending` `Domain` record, and the `local_businesses.domain_extraction_status` is updated to `completed`.
    - **Edge Case (No Website URL):** Verified. Setting status to `Selected` for a record with no `website_url` results in `domain_extraction_status` being correctly set to `completed` without any attempt to create a `Domain` record.

3.  **Documentation:**
    - `16.1-Work-Order-Local_Business-Row-Select-to-Domain-Table.md`: Work Order defining requirements.
    - `16.2-Work-Order-Implementation-Details-Local_Business-Domain-Table.md`: Implementation Details documenting backend code changes.
    - `16.3-Backend Testing Plan: Local Business Curation to Domain Table Trigger.md`: Backend Testing Plan outlining verification steps (including pending tests).

## II. Remaining Work

The primary focus shifts to the frontend implementation and completing one backend edge case test.

1.  **Backend Testing (Completion):**

    - **Edge Case (Duplicate Domain):** Execute the test as described in `16.3-Backend Testing Plan: Local Business Curation to Domain Table Trigger.md`. This involves:
      - Identifying two separate `local_businesses` records that share the exact same `website_url`.
      - Processing the _first_ business via the API and verifying the `Domain` record is created.
      - Processing the _second_ business via the API and verifying its `domain_extraction_status` goes to `completed` but **no new** (duplicate) `Domain` record is created. Check logs confirm the duplicate was detected and handled by the service.

2.  **Frontend Implementation (`static/google-maps.html` & related JS):**

    - **New Tab:** Create a new tab (e.g., "Local Business Curation") in the 3rd position. Use the existing "Staging Editor" tab as a structural and functional template.
    - **Data Grid:** Implement a data grid (e.g., using DataTables, matching the existing UI) to display data fetched from the `local_businesses` table. This requires a backing API endpoint (see next point).
    - **UI Controls:** Add standard grid controls: checkboxes for selecting rows, a dropdown menu populated with relevant statuses from `LocalBusinessApiStatusEnum` (`New`, `Selected`, `Maybe`, `Not a Fit`, `Archived`), and a button (e.g., "Update Status") to trigger the batch update.
    - **API Integration (JS):**
      - Write JavaScript to call the (yet-to-be-created) `GET /api/v3/local-businesses` endpoint to populate the data grid, handling pagination, filtering, and sorting based on user interaction.
      - Write JavaScript to collect selected `local_business_ids` and the chosen status from the UI controls, format them according to `LocalBusinessBatchStatusUpdateRequest`, and send the data to the `PUT /api/v3/local-businesses/status` endpoint upon button click. Handle API responses (success/error messages).

3.  **Backend API Endpoint (for Frontend):**
    - **Implement `GET /api/v3/local-businesses`:** Add this endpoint to `src/routers/local_businesses.py`.
    - **Functionality:** It should query the `local_businesses` table using SQLAlchemy.
    - **Features:** Must support pagination (e.g., `limit`, `offset` query parameters), filtering (e.g., by `status`, `business_name`), and sorting (e.g., `sort_by=name`, `sort_dir=asc`). Use Pydantic for request query parameters and the response model. Follow patterns from existing GET endpoints in other routers (like `places_staging.py`). **Crucially, filtering must allow the frontend to easily request only records needing curation (e.g., `status=New` or `status=Maybe`, or excluding `status=Selected`, `status=Archived`).**
