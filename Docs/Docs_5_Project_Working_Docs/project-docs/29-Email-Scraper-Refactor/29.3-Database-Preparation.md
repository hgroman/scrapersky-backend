# Micro Work Order: Database Preparation for Email Scraper Refactor

**Objective:** Define and prepare the necessary database structures (tables, models, enums) required to support storing scraped email contact information persistently, replacing the previous approach of storing results only in the `jobs.result_data` field or attempting to insert into non-existent tables.

**Context:** This is a prerequisite for the main refactoring work described in `29.1-Work-Order-Email-Scraper-Refactor.md`. The decision has been made to store contact details in a dedicated `contacts` table, mirroring the intent of the original (but broken) code, rather than solely in the `jobs` table. This also requires populating the `pages` table.

**Key Tasks:**

- [x] **1. Define & Create `contacts` Table Schema (Manual Action Required):**

  - Finalize the SQL DDL for the `contacts` table.
  - **Agreed Schema:**

    ```sql
    -- Define the ENUM type (if not already existing globally)
    -- CREATE TYPE contact_email_type_enum AS ENUM ('service', 'corporate', 'free', 'unknown');

    -- Create the table
    CREATE TABLE contacts (
        id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
        domain_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES domains(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
        page_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES pages(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Link to specific page
        email TEXT NOT NULL,
        email_type contact_email_type_enum, -- Use the ENUM type
        has_gmail BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- Store the flag
        context TEXT, -- Surrounding text from original extraction
        source_url TEXT, -- URL where email was found
        source_job_id UUID REFERENCES jobs(job_id) ON DELETE SET NULL, -- Link discovery Job
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
        updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
        UNIQUE (domain_id, email) -- Prevent duplicate emails per domain
    );

    -- Indices
    CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_domain_email ON contacts(domain_id, email);
    CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_page_id ON contacts(page_id);
    ```

  - **Action:** Manually execute this SQL DDL against the development database using a SQL client (e.g., Supabase SQL Editor), as Alembic is not currently used. **Ensure the `contact_email_type_enum` type is created before the table.** _(Verification confirmed this SQL was successfully executed.)_

- [x] **2. Define SQLAlchemy Models (Completed by AI):**

  - `[X]` Created new file: `src/models/contact.py`.
  - Define the `Contact` SQLAlchemy model class within this file, mapping accurately to the `contacts` table schema defined above. Include necessary imports (`Column`, `UUID`, `String`, `ForeignKey`, `Boolean`, `Text`, `DateTime`, `TIMESTAMP`, `Enum as SQLAlchemyEnum`, relationship, etc.) and inherit from `BaseModel`.
  - `[X]` Used `SQLAlchemyEnum(ContactEmailTypeEnum, name="contact_email_type_enum", create_type=False)` for the `email_type` column definition.
  - Establish relationships (e.g., `domain = relationship("Domain", back_populates="contacts")`, `page = relationship("Page", back_populates="contacts")`, `job = relationship("Job")`). Update the corresponding `Domain` and `Page` models to include the `back_populates` side (`contacts = relationship("Contact", back_populates="...")`).

- [x] **3. Define/Verify `Page` Model (Completed by AI):**

  - `[X]` Created new file `src/models/page.py` with the `Page` model definition based on the inspected `pages` table schema.

- [x] **4. Establish Relationships (Completed by AI):**
  - `[X]` Established relationships in `src/models/contact.py`: `domain = relationship("Domain", back_populates="contacts")`, `page = relationship("Page", back_populates="contacts")`, `job = relationship("Job")`.
  - `[X]` Updated `src/models/domain.py` to include `contacts = relationship("Contact", back_populates="domain")` and `pages = relationship("Page", back_populates="domain")`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- `[X]` The `contact_email_type_enum` type exists in the database. **(Manual Check Required)**
- `[X]` The `contacts` table exists in the database with the correct columns, types, constraints, and indices. **(Manual Check Required)**
- `[X]` The `src/models/contact.py` file exists containing the `Contact` SQLAlchemy model and `ContactEmailTypeEnum` Python enum.
- `[X]` The `Contact` model accurately maps to the database table structure.
- `[X]` The `src/models/page.py` file exists containing the `Page` model.
- `[X]` Relationships between `Contact`, `Domain`, `Page`, and `Job` are defined in the respective models (including `back_populates`).
- `[X]` The `Page` model exists and is ready for use by the email scraper task.

**Next Steps:** All database and model preparations are complete. The main refactoring work in `29.1` can proceed, updating the task logic to use the new `Contact` and `Page` models for data persistence.
