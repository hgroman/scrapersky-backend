# Work Order: Post-MVP Page Rename Tasks

**Date:** 2024-07-16
**Assignee:** AI Assistant / Developer
**Context:** Following the renaming of `static/google-maps.html` to `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` to better reflect its role as the primary backend development/testing interface.
**Related Files:** `28.1`, `28.2`, `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/*`

## Objective

Ensure all necessary code, documentation, and related artifacts are updated and consistent following the rename of the main static interface page. Verify the conceptual clarity of the page's role and address potential technical side effects.

## Prioritized Tasks (General to Specific)

1.  **Reinforce "MVP Interface" Role (Documentation):**

    - **Action:** Update high-level project documentation (e.g., main `README.md`, potentially `0.3_...Roadmap.md`) to explicitly state that `/static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` is the designated entry point for interacting with and testing the core backend workflows during MVP development.
    - **Rationale:** Solidifies the conceptual understanding of the page's purpose within the project structure.
    - **Status:** [x] DONE

2.  **Review Static File Structure & Cleanup (Context/Hygiene):**

    - **Action:**
      - Review the contents of the `/static` directory. Clarify the relationship between `scraper-sky-mvp.html` and other key pages (`index.html`, `dev-tools.html`, etc.) in documentation if needed.
      - Identify and schedule the removal of backup (`*.bak`) and copy (`*copy.html`) files to reduce clutter.
    - **Rationale:** Provides situational awareness and improves project hygiene.
    - **Status:** [ ] TODO

3.  **Check Internal Content Consistency (HTML):**

    - **Action:** Briefly review the internal headers and text within the tabs of `scraper-sky-mvp.html` (e.g., "Search for Places").
    - **Consideration:** Decide if minor text adjustments are needed to align with the overall "MVP" page theme, or if the current specific headers are sufficiently clear. Document decision if changes are deemed unnecessary.
    - **Rationale:** Ensures the content within the page is logical and consistent with its overall naming and purpose.
    - **Status:** [x] DONE

4.  **Search for Code/Comment References (Code):**

    - **Action:** Perform a codebase search (e.g., using `grep` or IDE search) across `/src` and `/static/js` for any remaining instances of the string "google-maps.html".
    - **Remediation:** Update any found references in comments or code literals to `scraper-sky-mvp.html`.
    - **Rationale:** Catches potentially missed references in code artifacts, improving maintainability.
    - **Status:** [x] DONE

5.  **Update Automated Tests (Testing):**
    - **Action:** Identify any automated end-to-end tests (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) that interact with the static interface.
    - **Remediation:** Update test scripts to use the new URL `/static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` instead of the old one.
    - **Documentation:** Add a note to testing documentation or create a task confirming this check/update is required.
    - **Rationale:** Ensures automated test suites reliant on this page are functional.
    - **Status:** [ ] TODO

## Completion Criteria

- All documentation references are updated.
- Static directory structure reviewed and cleanup scheduled/performed.
- Internal page content consistency confirmed.
- Codebase search completed and necessary updates made.
- Automated tests (if applicable) are updated and passing.
