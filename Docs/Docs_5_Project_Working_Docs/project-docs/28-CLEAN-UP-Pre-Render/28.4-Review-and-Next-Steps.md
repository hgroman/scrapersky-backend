Phase 3: Git & Env Hygiene

Archived any _.backup_, src/services/_.backup_, unfinished scripts to \_Archive_4.13.25/

Updated .gitignore to exclude backups, archives, workspace files

Regenerated requirements.txt from current venv

Follow‑up PRs

📈 7. CI Integration & Guardrails
.github/workflows/cleanup-check.yml to run trace and fail if new orphans appear.

Optional Pre‑commit Hook to block unreviewed deletions.

🗓️ 8. Suggested Timeline
Day 1: Steps 1–2 → initial PR

Day 2–3: Review & archive → merge

Day 4: Run Vulture → schedule follow‑ups

Ongoing: Monitor via CI check

With Phases 1–3 already out of the way, this 0–8 plan will drive a safe, fully audited cleanup of all unused code. Let me know if you’d like any further tweaks!

You kind of took the ball and ran with something different. You were giving feedback to my local AI that was incorporating your feedback, but I'm not sure what you just gave me there. How do I take what you gave me and give it to my AI to incorporate incorporate that into the work order we're doing.

ChatGPT said:
Try feeding your AI assistant the following prompt. It tells it exactly how to merge the “already‑completed” cleanup steps into the top of your work order and re‑structure the sections without destructive edits:

Prompt for the AI:

Please update our “Work Order: Identify & Archive Unused Code in ScraperSky Backend” document by folding in the previously completed Phases 1–3 at the very top as a new “0. Already‑Completed Critical Hygiene” section.

Prepend a new section called “0. Already‑Completed Critical Hygiene” that lists:

Deleted .env.bak

Archived bin/, run_tests.sh, setup.py, CURSOR.md into \_Archive_4.13.25/

Archived all _.backup_ and updated .gitignore

Regenerated requirements.txt

Renumber the remaining sections from 1 → 8 accordingly.

Ensure each step retains its original language and level of detail—no destructive edits.

At the end, add a short “Next Steps” bullet reminding us to open PR for review.

Structure and tone must be concise, clear, and non‑destructive. Output the full revised work‑order in markdown.

Just paste that into your AI’s prompt box and it should integrate the completed cleanup phases at the top, re‑number everything, and leave the rest intact.

Are you being thorough? I kind of feel like you're all over the place. I gave you three different documents that I haven't shared with it yet because I've kept its context pure I've shared them with you. You shared this big cool outline with me, but I'm trying to figure out how to give that to the other AI to incorporate the workflow and I asked you but now you've give me this prompt that seems really puny

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a more comprehensive prompt you can drop into your AI to merge all three documents into one master work order:

Prompt for the AI:

You have three source documents:

A. Work Order: Identify & Archive Unused Code in ScraperSky Backend (v2.0)
B. Cleanup Work Order (Phases 1–3, “already completed” hygiene steps)
C. Ruff Cleanup Micro Plan & Post‑MVP Page Rename Tasks

Please produce a single consolidated “Cleanup & Archive Work Order” in Markdown, with these requirements:

Section 0: Already‐Completed Cleanup

Summarize Phase 1 (Delete .env.bak), Phase 2 (archived bin/, run_tests.sh, setup.py, CURSOR.md to \_Archive_4.13.25/), and Phase 3 (git ignore updates, archived _.backup_, regenerating requirements.txt).

Keep the exact file names and brief reasons.

Section 1: Identify & Archive Unused Code

Fold in the import‐tracing plan from document A, now numbered Section 1.

Retain all steps, sub‑steps, notes, limitations, and the YAML example for exclusions.

Section 2: Within‑File Dead‐Code Sweep

Pull in the Ruff Cleanup Micro Plan from document C exactly, renumber it Section 2, preserving its “STATUS,” goals, and step‑by‑step actions.

Section 3: Post‑MVP Page Rename Tasks

Pull in the Post‑MVP Page Rename Tasks from document C, renumbered Section 3, keeping its prioritized tasks and statuses.

Renumber all subsequent sections accordingly.

Next Steps (at the very end):

Remind to open a review PR with the reports and proposed git mvs.

Suggest scheduling the Ruff and Vulture follow‑ups once the archive PR is merged.

Style & Tone:

Use clear, concise headings and bullet lists.

Do not delete or rewrite any original step language—only renumber and reorganize.

Preserve code blocks, YAML, and shell examples verbatim.

Keep it fully non‑destructive and ready for a human review PR.

Output the entire merged work order in Markdown.
