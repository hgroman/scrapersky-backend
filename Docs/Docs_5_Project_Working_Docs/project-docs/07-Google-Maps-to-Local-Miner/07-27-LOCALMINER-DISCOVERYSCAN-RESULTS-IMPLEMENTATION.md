# LocalMiner Discovery Scan Results Implementation

## Overview

This work order documents the implementation of the Results functionality for the LocalMiner Discovery Scan API. This completes the user flow from submitting a search to viewing the results, enabling users to access the places found during discovery scans.

## Implemented Features

1. **Results Retrieval Endpoint**: Added `/api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/results/{job_id}` endpoint to fetch search results for a specific job.
2. **Search History Endpoint**: Added `/api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/history` endpoint to retrieve past searches and prevent duplicates.
3. **Results Viewing in UI**: Updated the static page to support viewing results from completed searches.
4. **"View Results" Button**: Added a button to the status panel that appears when a search is complete, allowing users to navigate directly to the results.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Job Results Endpoint

The endpoint leverages the existing `get_places_for_job()` method in `PlacesStorageService`, maintaining architectural consistency. It returns a comprehensive response including:

- Places discovered during the search
- Total result count and pagination details
- Job information (business type, location, status, timestamps)

```python
@router.get("/results/{job_id}", response_model=Dict)
async def get_job_results(
    job_id: str,
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_dependency),
    current_user: Dict = Depends(get_current_user),
    limit: int = Query(100, ge=1, le=1000),
    offset: int = Query(0, ge=0)
) -> Dict:
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Search History Endpoint

This endpoint enables viewing past searches, which will be useful for:

- Preventing duplicate searches
- Accessing historical search data
- Tracking usage patterns

```python
@router.get("/search/history", response_model=List[Dict])
async def get_search_history(
    session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session_dependency),
    current_user: Dict = Depends(get_current_user),
    limit: int = Query(20, ge=1, le=100),
    offset: int = Query(0, ge=0),
    status: Optional[str] = None,
    tenant_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> List[Dict]:
    # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Frontend Updates

1. **View Results Button**: Added to the status panel when a search completes:

   ```javascript
   statusContent.innerHTML += `
       <button id="viewResultsBtn" class="button-primary" style="margin-top: 15px;">View Results</button>
   `;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Results Fetching**: Updated to use the new endpoint and support job-specific results:

   ```javascript
   let url = `/api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/results/${jobIdToUse}?limit=${limit}&offset=${offset}`;
   ```

3. **Job ID Tracking**: Added support for tracking the last completed job ID:

   ```javascript
   // Add a variable to store the last completed job ID
   let lastCompletedJobId = null;

   // Store the job ID when a search completes
   lastCompletedJobId = currentJobId;
   ```

## Architectural Considerations

All implementation follows the core architectural principles from the AI guides:

1. **Standard UUID Usage**: All IDs are properly handled as UUIDs in the database and as strings in API responses.
2. **Database Connection Patterns**: All database operations follow the established patterns with proper transaction management.
3. **Authentication at the Boundary**: Authentication remains at the API gateway level.
4. **Standardized Endpoints**: The endpoint naming follows the established pattern for consistency.
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases.

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **Direct API Calls**: Verified that the endpoints work correctly when called directly.
2. **UI Integration**: Tested the static page to ensure it can properly display results.
3. **Complete User Flow**: Verified the entire flow from submitting a search to viewing results.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Duplicate Search Prevention**: Add functionality to detect and warn about duplicate searches.
2. **Results Filtering**: Enhance filtering capabilities on the results endpoint.
3. **Batch Operations**: Add support for bulk operations on search results.

## Standardization Notes

This implementation serves as a pattern for similar functionality in other endpoints, such as sitemap endpoints. The approach is consistent and standardized, making it easy to replicate across different features.
