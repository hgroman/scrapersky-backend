# Specification: Standardize Tab 4 (Domain Curation) - Filters & JS

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2024-07-27

## 1. Goal

This specification outlines the requirements to:

1.  Ensure the **existing** "Search by Domain Name" filter input on the "Domain Curation" tab (Tab 4) correctly filters the data by connecting to the backend API.
2.  Ensure all JavaScript logic specific to this tab is externalized into `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js`, adhering to project standards.
3.  Explicitly preserve the current look and feel of the tab.

## 2. Background & Context

The "Domain Curation" tab allows viewing and managing `Domain` records, specifically for selecting domains for sitemap analysis. It includes filter controls, and this effort ensures the existing Domain Name filter functions correctly and that the controlling JavaScript follows project standards for externalization and initialization.

## 3. References

- **HTML File:** `static/google-maps.html` (specifically the `#domainCurationPanel` panel)
- **Target JS File:** `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js`
- **Standard Practice:** Externalizing panel-specific JavaScript and using delayed initialization (Ref: `23.4-Supplemental.md`).

## 4. Backend API Prerequisites (Verified)

- **List Endpoint:** `GET /api/v3/domains/` exists.
- **Filter Parameter:** The list endpoint supports filtering via the `domain_filter` query parameter (case-insensitive partial match, e.g., `?domain_filter=example.com`).

## 5. Frontend Requirements

### 5.1. JavaScript Refactoring (Externalization)

- **Audit `static/google-maps.html`:** Review the main inline `<script>` block.
- **Identify & Move Logic:** Any JavaScript code that directly manipulates or adds event listeners specifically for elements within the `#domainCurationPanel` panel MUST be moved to the `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js` file.
- **Ensure Delayed Initialization:** All logic within `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js` (including newly moved code) MUST be structured to execute only when the "Domain Curation" tab is active (e.g., via tab click listener or MutationObserver). Direct execution on `DOMContentLoaded` for panel-specific setup is prohibited.

### 5.2. Connect Domain Name Filter Logic

- **Prerequisite:** Verify the `id` of the existing text input field for filtering by Domain Name within the `#domainCurationFilterControls` section. Assume `id="domainCurationNameFilter"` based on the HTML structure.
- **JavaScript Modifications (`/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js`):**
  - **Apply Filter Logic:** Ensure the event handler for the "Apply Filters" button (`#applyDomainCurationFilters`) reads the `.value` from the `#domainCurationNameFilter` input. The `fetchDomainCurationData` function (or equivalent) must include the `domain_filter` query parameter in the API call to `GET /api/v3/domains/` if the input field is not empty.
  - **Reset Filter Logic:** Ensure the event handler for the "Reset Filters" button (`#resetDomainCurationFilters`) clears the value of the `#domainCurationNameFilter` input field.

### 5.3. Preserve Look and Feel

- No changes should be made to the existing HTML structure or CSS styling of the Domain Curation tab. The goal is functional connection and JS refactoring only.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

1.  No JavaScript logic specific to the `#domainCurationPanel` panel remains inline within `static/google-maps.html`.
2.  All JavaScript for Tab 4 resides in `/static/js/domain-curation-tab.js` and initializes correctly only upon tab activation.
3.  The existing "Search by Domain Name" text input field functions correctly.
4.  Applying the filter triggers an API call with the correct `domain_filter` query parameter.
5.  The displayed table updates correctly based on the name filter.
6.  Resetting filters clears the name input and removes the filter from the data request.
7.  Existing status filter, pagination, selection, and batch update functionality for Tab 4 remain fully operational.
8.  The visual appearance of the Domain Curation tab remains unchanged.
