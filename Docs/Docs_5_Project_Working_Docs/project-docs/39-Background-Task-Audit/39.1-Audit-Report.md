# Background Task Audit Report

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-04-18 (Based on Work Order Date)
**Related Work Order:** `project-docs/39-Word-Order.md`
**Related Architecture Overview:** `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md`

**1. Introduction**

This report details the findings of an audit of background task initiation and execution patterns within the ScraperSky backend codebase. The primary objective was to identify all background tasks, analyze their implementation against the established standard architectural pattern (APScheduler polling database status columns), and specifically assess the Email Extraction workflow (`ContactLaunchpad`) for compliance. This audit aims to ensure system stability, maintainability, and predictability by identifying non-compliant implementations for potential refactoring.

**2. Audit Findings Summary**

Two primary patterns for initiating background processing were identified:

- **Standard Pattern:** Tasks triggered by the shared APScheduler instance polling specific database tables/columns for status changes. These tasks generally manage their database sessions correctly using `get_background_session()`.
- **Non-Standard Pattern:** Tasks triggered directly by API endpoint calls using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`. While the background functions themselves appear to handle sessions correctly using `get_background_session()`, the trigger mechanism deviates from the standard pattern, which is typically preferred for potentially long-running or resource-intensive tasks.

**4. Detailed Findings & Discussion**

- **Standard Pattern Usage:** The codebase makes good use of the standard APScheduler polling pattern for several core processes (domain metadata extraction, sitemap processing via job queue, deep scans, domain extraction from local business). These jobs correctly utilize `get_background_session()` to ensure proper session management and transaction isolation, either per-batch or per-task.
- **Non-Standard Pattern Usage:** A significant number of workflows, including critical ones like Email Extraction (`ContactLaunchpad`) and Batch Sitemap/Page processing, are initiated directly from API endpoints using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
  - **Session Management:** The background functions invoked by these routers (`scan_website_for_emails`, `process_sitemap_batch_with_own_session`, etc.) _do_ appear to handle their database sessions correctly by obtaining a new session via `get_background_session()`. This avoids issues related to using the closed request session.
  - **Architectural Concern:** The primary concern with this pattern is its deviation from the project standard documented in [Guide 21](Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/21-SCHEDULED_TASKS_APSCHEDULER_PATTERN.md) and [Guide 24](Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/24-SHARED_SCHEDULER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md). Using `BackgroundTasks` for potentially long-running, database-intensive operations can lead to:
    - **Reliability Issues:** If the application server restarts while a background task is running, the task might be lost without a persistent job record to allow reprocessing.
    - **Scalability/Resource Management:** It becomes harder to control and monitor the execution of many background tasks triggered directly by API load compared to a controlled number of scheduler instances pulling from a queue.
    - **Observability:** Tracking the status and history of tasks triggered via `BackgroundTasks` often relies on custom logging or status updates within the task itself, whereas the standard pattern uses the `Job` table (or status on the main entity) providing a central point for status tracking.

**5. Email Extraction (`ContactLaunchpad`) Refactor Plan**

The Email Extraction workflow (`POST /scan/website` -> `scan_website_for_emails` task) is functional but uses the non-standard API `BackgroundTasks` trigger. To align with project standards and improve robustness, the following refactoring steps are recommended:

1.  **Modify API Endpoint (`src/routers/email_scanner.py::scan_website_for_emails_api`):**

    - Remove the `background_tasks: BackgroundTasks` dependency and the `background_tasks.add_task(...)` call.
    - Keep the logic that checks for existing `PENDING`/`RUNNING` jobs.
    - Ensure the logic correctly creates a `Job` record with `job_type='email_scan'` and `status=TaskStatus.PENDING`.
    - The endpoint should simply return the `job_id` after successfully creating/committing the pending job record.

2.  **Create/Modify Scheduler Job:**

    - A new scheduler job needs to be defined (potentially in a new `src/services/email_scan_scheduler.py` or added to an existing relevant scheduler like `sitemap_scheduler.py` if appropriate, although separation might be cleaner).
    - This job should be configured using `scheduler.add_job` with an `IntervalTrigger`.
    - The scheduled function should:
      - Use `get_background_session()`.
      - Query the `Job` table for jobs where `job_type='email_scan'` and `status=TaskStatus.PENDING`, applying appropriate limits and locking (`with_for_update(skip_locked=True)`).
      - For each pending job found:
        - Mark the job status as `RUNNING` (within the scheduler's transaction or ideally within the task's transaction start).
        - Call the core email scanning logic, likely by invoking `scan_website_for_emails(job_id=job.job_id, user_id=job.created_by)`.
        - Handle potential errors during the invocation.

3.  **Adapt Task Function (`src/tasks/email_scraper.py::scan_website_for_emails`):**
    - No significant changes should be needed here, as it already correctly uses `get_background_session()` to manage its own session and updates the `Job` status upon completion or failure. Ensure it handles the transition from PENDING -> RUNNING -> COMPLETED/FAILED correctly.

**Benefits of Refactoring:**

- **Alignment:** Brings the Email Extraction workflow into compliance with the project's standard background task architecture.
- **Reliability:** Jobs are persisted in the database, allowing for retries or recovery if the application restarts.
- **Control & Observability:** Execution is controlled by the scheduler, and status is tracked centrally in the `Job` table.

**6. Conclusion & Recommendations**

The audit found that while core scheduled tasks adhere to the standard pattern, several critical workflows rely on direct API triggering via `BackgroundTasks`. Although the session management within these tasks appears correct, the trigger mechanism deviates from standards.

- **Recommendation 1:** Prioritize refactoring the Email Extraction (`ContactLaunchpad`) workflow as outlined above to use the standard scheduler polling pattern.
- **Recommendation 2:** Evaluate other workflows using the non-standard `BackgroundTasks` trigger (Batch Sitemap, Batch Page Scraper) and consider refactoring them to the standard pattern for consistency and robustness, potentially in subsequent work orders.
- **Recommendation 3:** Ensure any _new_ background task development strictly adheres to the standard APScheduler polling pattern unless there's a compelling, documented reason to deviate (e.g., very short, non-critical tasks like sending a notification).
