# Project Status: Code Audit & Archival - Zoom Out (As of Last Interaction)

## 1. Initial Goal & Methodology

- **Objective:** Identify and safely archive unused Python (`.py`) files within the `src/` directory of the ScraperSky backend codebase to improve maintainability.
- **Process Stages:**
  1.  **Static Analysis:** Used custom tools (`tools/trace_imports.py`, `tools/run_full_trace.py`) to perform AST-based dependency tracing, identifying an initial list of ~21 potential unused candidates.
  2.  **Runtime Analysis:** Executed the application (`src/main.py`) with runtime import tracing (`src/config/runtime_tracer.py`) to identify **35 `.py` files** definitively loaded during startup (**Category 1 - Confirmed Used**).
  3.  **Manual Review & Initial Archival:** Cross-referenced static candidates with runtime list and performed manual audits. Resulted in **20 files** confirmed as unused and moved to `_Archive_4.13.25/Code-Archive-25.04.19/src/` (**Category 2 - Archived Candidates**).
  4.  **Category 3 Investigation:** Focused on the remaining **~61 `.py` files** (not loaded at startup, not previously archived, but potentially linked via static analysis). Used `grep` and contextual analysis to determine if links were valid (scripts, tests, jobs, infrequent code) or stale. Findings documented in `41.20-Category3-File-Investigation.md` and summarized in `41.21-Inception-Review.md`, initially recommending **18 files** for archival.

## 2. Current Phase: Implementing Category 3 Archival & Encountered Problems

- **Action:** Attempted to implement the recommendation from `41.21` by moving the 18 identified Category 3 files to the archive directory.
- **Outcome:** The application **failed to start** after moving the files, encountering a series of `ModuleNotFoundError` exceptions during subsequent rebuild/restart attempts.
- **Iterative Debugging:** A frustrating cycle ensued where each `ModuleNotFoundError` was fixed by restoring the specific missing file from the archive, only to reveal another missing dependency upon the next restart.

## 3. Root Cause of Failures

- **Flawed Initial Analysis:** The core issue is that the initial static analysis and the focused Category 3 investigation were **insufficient**. They failed to accurately trace the _complete_ dependency chains, particularly those originating from **Category 1 files** (like `src/main.py` and the routers it imports) and those involving multiple layers of service calls.
- **Audit Blind Spot:** The process over-emphasized identifying unused files (Category 3) and lacked a rigorous verification step to ensure that _all_ dependencies required by the core application entry point (`src/main.py`) and its direct imports were correctly identified and _not_ marked for archival.

## 4. Files Incorrectly Archived & Restored So Far

The following files were initially moved to the archive based on the flawed Category 3 analysis but had to be restored to fix runtime `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` exceptions:

1.  `src/models/user.py` (Required by `src/models/__init__.py`)
2.  `src/services/batch/batch_functions.py` (Required by `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`)
3.  `src/services/batch/batch_processor_service.py` (Required by `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`)
4.  `src/services/batch/types.py` (Required by other `services/batch/*` files)
5.  `src/services/core/db_service.py` (Required via import chain originating from `batch_page_scraper.py`)
6.  `src/services/core/validation_service.py` (Required via import chain originating from `batch_page_scraper.py`)
7.  `src/services/core/user_context_service.py` (Required via import chain originating from `batch_page_scraper.py`)
8.  `src/utils/db_helpers.py` (Required by `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`)
9.  `src/core/exceptions.py` (Required via `src/routers/profile.py` -> `src/core/response.py`)
10. `src/core/response.py` (Required by `src/routers/profile.py`)
11. `src/routers/sqlalchemy/__init__.py` (Required by `src/main.py`)

**Files Remaining in Archive (Requires Verification):** Based on initial candidates (20 Cat2 + 18 Cat3 = 38) minus restorations (11), approximately **27 files** should currently reside in `_Archive_4.13.25/Code-Archive-25.04.19/src/`. Verification needed.

**Note:** The documentation manifest (`Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/archived_code_candidates.md`) has **not** yet been fully updated to reflect the restoration of all these files due to tool issues during the process. Manual correction is required.

## 5. Current Status & Next Steps

- **Current Error:** The application is **still failing** on startup with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.models.enums'`, triggered by an import in `src/services/domain_scheduler.py` (which is imported by `src/main.py`).
- **Immediate Next Step (Before Pause):** The next logical fix in the reactive cycle would be to restore `src/models/enums.py`.
- **Strategic Pivot:** Recognizing the failure of the reactive approach, the process was **paused**. The agreed-upon next step is to **stop restoring files one by one**.
- **Revised Plan:**
  1.  **Perform a Systematic Top-Down Dependency Trace:** Starting from `src/main.py`, map _all_ necessary imports recursively to build a definitive list of required modules.
  2.  **Leverage/Re-evaluate Static Analysis:** Re-examine existing static analysis reports (`reports/`) or potentially re-run tracing tools focused on the `main.py` entry point. Note known limitations of existing static tools in tracing full chains from runtime entry points (see `41.10`, `41.11`).
  3.  **Correct the Archive List:** Cross-reference the definitive required module list with the current archive contents and the original archival recommendations (`41.21`). Restore _all_ necessary files.
  4.  **Update Documentation:** Accurately update the Category 3 investigation log (`41.20`), the archive manifest (`archived_code_candidates.md`), and potentially create new documentation detailing this corrective trace.
  5.  **Attempt Restart:** Only after completing the above steps, attempt to rebuild and restart the application.
- **Key Inputs for Next Phase:**
  - `src/main.py`
  - `src/routers/__init__.py`
  - `reports/runtime_startup_loaded_files.txt` (List of Category 1 files)
  - Original list of ~61 Category 3 files (derive from `src/`, Cat1 list, Cat2 list)
  - Existing analysis reports in `reports/`.
- **Supporting Documentation Created:**
  - Dependency Tree Docs (Markdown): `41.22-DTree-Batch-Domain-Scanner.md`, `41.23-DTree-Single-Domain-Scanner.md`, `41.24-DTree-Content-Map.md`.
  - Dependency Tree Data (JSON): `reports/dependency_tree_batch_scanner.json`, `reports/dependency_tree_single_scanner.json`, `reports/dependency_tree_content_map.json`.
  - Frontend Bug Identified: `contentmap.html` calls incorrect backend endpoints for batch sitemap analysis.
  - **Dependency Tree Generation Process:**
    - Analyzed the specified HTML file (`static/*.html`).
    - Reviewed embedded JavaScript, identifying API calls (`fetch`) and target endpoint URLs/methods.
    - Mapped API endpoints to corresponding backend router files (`src/routers/*.py`) based on URL prefixes.
    - Examined router source code to identify direct imports and dependencies.
    - Recursively traced dependencies through service layers, models, and utilities.
    - Documented the findings in a structured Markdown format (`41.22` - `41.24`).
    - Converted the Markdown structure into a corresponding JSON report (`reports/dependency_tree_*.json`).

## 6. Outstanding Tasks (Beyond Immediate Dependency Trace)

- Manually update `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/archived_code_candidates.md` to remove entries for all restored files.
- Fix frontend bug in `static/contentmap.html` (incorrect batch API endpoints).
- Potentially re-evaluate `src/services/batch/simple_task_test.py` for archival once the application is stable.

## 7. Environment Context

- The application is run and tested using Docker via `docker-compose.yml`.
- Testing involves `docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache <service> && docker-compose up -d <service>` followed by checking logs (`docker-compose logs <service>`) and potentially health checks/API calls.

This detailed status update should allow another AI assistant to understand the situation, the flaws in the prior process, and the revised plan to achieve a stable state and complete the audit accurately.
