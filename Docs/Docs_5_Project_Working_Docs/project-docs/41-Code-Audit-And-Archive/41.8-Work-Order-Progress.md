## Completed Steps

### Section 0: Pre-Flight & Safety

- **0.1:** `reports/` directory created.
- **0.2:** Branch `feature/code-cleanup-20250418` created and checked out.
- **0.3:** Backup tag `pre-cleanup-2025-04-18` created.
- **0.4:** Rollback command noted.

### Section 1 & Tooling Evolution: Entry-Point & Automated Import Tracing

- **(Details):** Documented the evolution from `modulefinder` -> failed `importlab` script -> hybrid AST -> comprehensive tracing tools (`run_full_trace.py`, `scheduler_trace.py`, `dynamic_imports.py`, router-specific tracers, functional mapper).
- **(Output):** `reports/unused_candidates.json` (21 files), `reports/used_files_static_ast_main.json`, `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`.

### Section 2: Exclude-List & Configuration

- **2.1:** Config file `reports/cleanup_config.yaml` created with default exclusions.
- **2.2:** Trace script configured to use the config file.

### Phase 1: High-Priority Candidate Audit & Cleanup (Added 2025-04-25)

- **Runtime Analysis:**
  - Implemented `sys.settrace` in `src/main.py` lifespan events (via `src/config/runtime_tracer.py`, based on `41.17`).
  - Started the server and captured runtime loaded modules at startup.
  - Generated `reports/runtime_startup_loaded_files.txt` (listing 35 files).
- **Cross-Referencing:**
  - Compared static candidates (`unused_candidates.json` - 21 files) with runtime loaded files (`runtime_startup_loaded_files.txt` - 35 files).
  - Confirmed **no overlap**: the 21 static candidates were not loaded at startup.
- **Manual Audit (High Priority):**
  - Created work order for manual review of the 21 candidates.
  - Executed audit following `41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md` methodology (grep for imports/usage).
  - Documented findings in `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.19-Manual-Audit-Log.md`.
  - **Initial Outcome:** 15 files marked "Archive", 6 files marked "Keep (Referenced)".
- **Functionality Review & Manifest Creation:**
  - Reviewed layman's functionality descriptions for the 15 "Archive" candidates.
  - Created `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/archived_code_candidates.md` manifest detailing these 15 files, their functionality, and key classes/functions.
- **Archiving & Initial Commit (15 Files):**
  - Moved 15 confirmed unused files to `_Archive_4.13.25/Code-Archive-25.04.19/src/`.
  - Committed manifest creation and file archival (Commit: `d522109`).
- **Re-Investigation of "Kept" Files:**
  - Created work order to re-investigate the 6 "Keep" files considering recent major refactoring (JWT, RBAC removal, etc.).
  - Executed re-investigation, focusing on stale references.
  - Documented findings in `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.18-Comprehensive-Audit-Process-And-Findings.md` (Section 5.6).
  - **Outcome:** 5 of the 6 files re-classified as "Archive Candidate (Stale Reference)". Only `src/services/storage/storage_service.py` confirmed as actively used.
- **Manifest Update, Cleanup & Final Commit (5 Files):**
  - Updated `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/archived_code_candidates.md` to include the 5 additional archive candidates (total 20).
  - Edited relevant `__init__.py` files (`src/services/core/__init__.py`, `src/services/__init__.py`, `src/services/scraping/__init__.py`) to remove exports of archived services.
  - Moved the 5 additional confirmed unused files to `_Archive_4.13.25/Code-Archive-25.04.19/src/`.
  - Committed manifest updates, `__init__.py` changes, and file archival (Commit: `93893f2`).
- **Validation:**
  - Restarted application using `docker-compose up --build --force-recreate`.
  - Confirmed service health via `docker-compose ps` and reviewed logs for errors.
  - Performed functional testing (reported successful).

## Current Status & Next Steps (Updated 2025-04-25)

- **Phase 1 (High-Priority Audit):** âœ… Completed. 20 files archived.
- **Remaining Files:** 116 (total) - 35 (runtime loaded) - 20 (archived) = **61 files** require further analysis (Category 3: Not runtime loaded, but also not initially flagged as unused by static analysis).
- **Next Phase:** Begin analysis of the 61 "Category 3" files.
  - **Step 1:** Generate the explicit list of these 61 files.
  - **Step 2:** Plan and execute a more efficient review strategy (e.g., enhance static trace logging, scripted searches) to determine why static analysis kept them and if they are genuinely used (e.g., by background jobs, specific APIs, tests) or can also be archived.

## 2025-04-19: Troubleshooting `trace_imports.py` and Strategic Pivot

**Status:** Blocked on Step 1.2 (Execute Trace)

**Efforts:**

1.  **Initial Failure:** The `tools/trace_imports.py` script consistently failed inside the Docker container with a misleading `Error: importlab is not installed`. This occurred despite verifying `importlab` was present in `requirements.txt`, installed in the container's `site-packages`, and importable via a minimal test script (`python -c "import importlab"`).
2.  **Environment Checks:** Exhaustive checks confirmed correct Docker volume mounts, `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, and user site-packages locations. Running the script as a module (`python -m tools.trace_imports`) also failed.
3.  **Diagnostic Enhancement:** Modified `trace_imports.py` to print detailed error info (`sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, specific `ImportError`).
4.  **Root Cause Identified:** The _actual_ error was `ImportError: cannot import name 'RelativeResolver' from 'importlab.resolve'`. Further investigation revealed:
    - The installed `importlab` version (0.8.1, latest on PyPI) **does not contain** the `RelativeResolver` or `AbsoluteResolver` classes.
    - The script was written assuming an API from a different (likely internal Google or custom fork) version of `importlab`.
    - The script's error handling masked the true API mismatch issue.
5.  **External Feedback & Strategic Pivot:** After documenting the issue and receiving external feedback confirming the impracticality of fixing the broken script/dependency, the decision was made to **abandon the `trace_imports.py` script**.

**New Approach (Hybrid AST + grep):**

- Will proceed by implementing a new, pragmatic approach to identify unused code candidates:
  1.  List all `.py` files in `src/` (respecting `cleanup_config.yaml` exclusions).
  2.  Use Python's `ast` module to build a _static_ import graph starting from `src/main.py` and included routers.
  3.  Generate `used_files.json` (statically reachable files) and `unused_candidates.json` (files not in the static graph).
- This bypasses the `importlab` dependency entirely and allows the work order to proceed directly to Step 1.3 (Review Reports).

**Next Step:** Re-evaluate the approach to code auditing with greater understanding of the system architecture and background services.

## Findings & Decisions

### Unused Code Candidates

Based on static analysis, the following 24 files were identified as potentially unused:

1. `src/api/models/places.py`
2. `src/auth/auth_service.py`
3. `src/db/direct_migration.py`
4. `src/db/direct_session.py`
5. `src/db/domain_handler.py`
6. `src/models/feature_flag.py`
7. `src/models/sidebar.py`
8. `src/schemas/contact.py`
9. `src/schemas/email_scan.py`
10. `src/scraper/data_formatter.py`
11. `src/services/batch/task_debugger.py`
12. `src/services/core/auth_service.py`
13. `src/services/db_inspector.py`
14. `src/services/domain_service.py`
15. `src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py`
16. `src/services/scraping/scrape_executor_service.py`
17. `src/services/sitemap/analyzer_service.py`
18. `src/services/sitemap/background_service.py`
19. `src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py`
20. `src/services/sitemap_service.py`
21. `src/services/storage/storage_service.py`
22. `src/utils/db_schema_helper.py`
23. `src/utils/db_utils.py`
24. `src/utils/sidebar.py`

## Critical Analysis Failure (2025-04-19)

### Failed Approach

The static analysis approach attempted was fundamentally flawed for this codebase:

1. **Background Services Not Accounted For:** The system heavily relies on background services, scheduled tasks, and components that may not be directly imported from the main entry point or routers.

2. **Architectural Misunderstanding:** There was a critical failure to understand core components like the Domain-to-Sitemap adapter service and other architectural elements.

3. **Over-reliance on Static Analysis:** Static code analysis alone is insufficient for determining actual code usage in a complex system with background services and scheduled tasks.

### All Files Restored

All 14 files that were erroneously archived have been fully restored to their original locations:

```
src/services/batch/task_debugger.py
src/services/domain_service.py
src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py
src/services/scraping/scrape_executor_service.py
src/services/sitemap/analyzer_service.py
src/services/sitemap/background_service.py
src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py
src/services/sitemap_service.py
src/services/storage/storage_service.py
src/api/models/places.py
src/models/feature_flag.py
src/models/sidebar.py
src/scraper/data_formatter.py
src/utils/sidebar.py
```

### Revised Approach Needed

A proper code audit for this system would require:

1. **Deep Architectural Understanding:** Comprehensive review of how background services, scheduled tasks, and adapter components operate.

2. **Runtime Analysis:** Monitoring actual system behavior during operation to determine which components are utilized.

3. **Developer Consultation:** Direct input from developers familiar with the system architecture and data flows.

## 2025-04-19: Implementing Improved Analysis Tools (per 41.10 Guide)

**Status:** New analysis reports generated.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Deprecated Old Tools:** Renamed `analyze_imports_ast.py`, `analyze_imports_ast_fixed.py`, and `compare_used_unused.py` with a `_deprecated.py` suffix.
2.  **Created New Tools:** Implemented the following scripts in `tools/` based on `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.10-Static Analysis Tool Improvement Guide.md`:
    - `tools/static_import_trace.py`: Traces static imports from `main.py` and scheduler entry points.
    - `tools/scheduler_trace.py`: Detects `scheduler.add_job` calls.
    - `tools/dynamic_imports.py`: Detects potential dynamic import patterns.
    - `tools/runtime_import_logger.py`: Provides mechanism for runtime import logging.
    - `tools/combined_trace.py`: Aggregates results from other reports.
3.  **Corrected Scripts:** Addressed syntax errors and improved path handling in the newly created scripts (specifically `static_import_trace.py` and `combined_trace.py`).
4.  **Executed Analyses:**
    - Ran `static_import_trace.py` (initial attempt, found 8 files).
    - Ran `scheduler_trace.py` --> `reports/scheduler_jobs.json`.
    - Ran `dynamic_imports.py` --> `reports/dynamic_imports.json`.
5.  **Debugged & Corrected Static Trace:** Identified that `static_import_trace.py` was failing to resolve relative imports correctly. Debugged and refactored the script.
6.  **Re-Executed Static Trace:** Ran the corrected `static_import_trace.py` --> `reports/used_files_static.json` (now correctly identifying 74 files).
7.  **Attempted Runtime Logging:**
    - Created `tests/conftest.py` with a fixture to enable `runtime_import_logger.py`.
    - Ran `pytest`, which encountered a test collection error (`ImportError` in `test_single_domain_scanner.py`). Runtime log generation (`reports/runtime_imports.log`) may be incomplete or missing as a result.
8.  **Combined Results (Updated):**
    - Re-ran `combined_trace.py` using the corrected static analysis report.
    - Generated `reports/used_files_combined.json` (74 used files identified based on static/scheduler/dynamic traces).
    - Generated `reports/unused_candidates_combined.json` (21 potentially unused files identified).
9.  **Archived Old Reports:** Moved older/unrelated files from `reports/` into `reports/archive/`.
10. **Archived Deprecated Tools:** Moved the renamed deprecated scripts from `tools/` into `_Archive_4.13.25/`.

**Assessment & Next Steps:**

- The improved tooling workflow has been implemented and executed.
- The static analysis component (`static_import_trace.py`) was successfully debugged and now provides a much more accurate trace of static imports from `main.py` and scheduler entry points.
- The resulting list in `reports/unused_candidates_combined.json` (21 candidates) is significantly more accurate than previous attempts, but relies primarily on static and scheduler analysis due to incomplete runtime data.
- Runtime analysis was likely hindered by the `pytest` error.
- **Next:** Thorough manual review of the 21 candidates in `reports/unused_candidates_combined.json`, cross-referencing with architectural knowledge and potentially the Critical Module Registry (if available), before considering any archiving actions. Resolving the `pytest` error and regenerating the runtime log could further refine the list.

## 2025-04-20: Router-Specific Tracing & Functional Mapping Completion

**Status:** Functional map generated, ready for manual audit.

**Actions Taken:**

1.  **Refined Core Trace:** Focused static analysis using `tools/run_full_trace.py` primarily on `src/main.py` and scheduler entry points identified previously.
2.  **Frontend Analysis & Endpoint Identification:** Analyzed frontend components (`admin-dashboard.html`, etc.) to identify specific API endpoints corresponding to distinct business functions/UI features.
3.  **Developed Router Trace Scripts:** Created dedicated scripts (`tools/trace_deps_*.py`) for each identified router endpoint (e.g., `google_maps_api.py`, `places_staging.py`, `local_businesses.py`, `domains.py`, `sitemap_files.py`, `modernized_page_scraper.py`, `modernized_sitemap.py`, `batch_sitemap.py`, `db_portal.py`, `dev_tools.py`).
4.  **Executed Router Traces:** Ran each `trace_deps_*.py` script to generate specific dependency lists (`reports/deps_*.json`) for each business function.
5.  **Developed Functional Mapper:** Created `tools/build_functional_map.py` to consolidate the dependency lists. This script maps files to business functions based directly on the trace results:
    - Files used by multiple functions are marked `Core/Shared`.
    - Files used by only one function retain that function's mapping.
    - Limited keyword-based categorization (`CoreFastAPI`, `BackgroundScheduler`, `ScrapingTask`) is used as a fallback for files not mapped via direct traces.
6.  **Generated Functional Map:** Ran `build_functional_map.py` to produce `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`.
    - **Result:** 74 total used files analyzed. 26 mapped to a single specific feature, 28 categorized as `Core/Shared` (used by multiple features), 7 mapped to generic categories (FastAPI, Scheduler, Task), leaving 13 files `Unmapped`.

**Assessment & Next Steps:**

- This targeted tracing approach, guided by frontend analysis, yielded a much more accurate functional map than previous attempts.
- The map (`Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`) provides a clear view of feature dependencies.
- The next critical step is the **manual review** of the 21 candidates listed in `reports/unused_candidates_combined.json`, using the process defined in `41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md`. The 13 `Unmapped` files from the functional map should also be considered during this audit.

## Common Pitfalls & Lessons Learned (2025-04-18)

### Why This Was So Painful

Modern Python projects using Docker, virtual environments, and IDEs (like VS Code or forks) often run into severe environment mismatches:

- **Multiple Python Environments:** Installing a package in your host venv does not affect your Docker container, and vice versa.
- **Volume Mounting:** If you don't mount every relevant directory (like `tools/`), your container won't see your scriptsâ€”even if they exist on your host.
- **User Site-Packages:** Installing with `pip install --user` puts packages in `~/.local`, which can be missed by Python if `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH` isn't set up just right, especially in multi-stage Docker builds.
- **Docker Build Caching:** Docker aggressively caches layers. If requirements or install steps change but Docker doesn't detect it, new dependencies may not be installed in the rebuilt image.
- **Entrypoint/Working Directory Confusion:** Running scripts as modules vs. files (`python -m ...` vs `python ...`) can change import resolution.

### Specific Pain Points in This Project

- `importlab` was present and importable in minimal tests, but not when running the full script due to subtle path and environment differences inside Docker.
- The script's own `sys.path` manipulation (to find `src/`
