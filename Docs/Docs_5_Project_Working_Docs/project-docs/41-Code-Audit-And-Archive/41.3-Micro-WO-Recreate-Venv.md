# Micro Work Order: Recreate Local Python Virtual Environment (.venv)

**Date:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')
**Reason:** Persistent issues resolving the `importlab` package within the existing `.venv`, even after seemingly successful installations. The environment appears inconsistent or corrupted.
**Goal:** Create a clean, functional virtual environment to allow the `tools/trace_imports.py` script to run correctly.
**Branch:** `feature/code-cleanup-20250418`

## Steps

1.  **Remove Existing Environment:**
    - Command: `rm -rf .venv`
    - Verification: Check that the `.venv` directory is gone.
2.  **Create New Environment:**
    - Command: `python3 -m venv .venv` (Using `python3` for clarity, adjust if needed)
    - Verification: Check that the `.venv` directory exists and contains `bin/python`, `bin/pip`, etc.
3.  **Activate New Environment (User Action):**
    - Command: `source .venv/bin/activate` (or equivalent for your shell)
    - Verification: Shell prompt should indicate the active environment (e.g., `(.venv)`).
4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    - Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - Verification: Check for successful installation output without errors.
5.  **Verify `importlab` Installation:**
    - Command: `.venv/bin/pip show importlab`
    - Verification: Command should output package details (Name, Version, Location within `.venv`, etc.) and _not_ report "Package(s) not found".
6.  **Test Trace Script:**
    - Command: `.venv/bin/python tools/trace_imports.py`
    - Verification: Script should run without the "importlab not installed" error and proceed with the import graph analysis.
