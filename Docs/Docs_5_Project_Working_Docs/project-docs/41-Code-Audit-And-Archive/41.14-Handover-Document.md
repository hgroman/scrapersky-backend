# HANDOVER DOCUMENT: ScraperSky-Back-End Audit Project

## 1. PROJECT STATUS

We are conducting a code audit to identify unused code while resolving compatibility issues with the upgraded `psycopg` library (v3.2.5). The immediate issue is with `src/services/core/db_service.py`, which violates the project's ORM-only architecture principle and is causing linter errors due to incompatible usage of `row_factory`.

## 2. ACCOMPLISHED TASKS

1. **Functional Dependency Map Created**: Executed a series of trace scripts that mapped all code dependencies to specific functional areas. This map is stored in `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`.

2. **Identification of Non-Compliant Database Access**: Confirmed that `db_service.py` uses raw SQL queries instead of ORM, violating the project's architectural principles.

3. **Feature Dependency Analysis**: Verified that `db_service.py` is used by exactly four features:

   - ContentMap (from `modernized_sitemap.py`)
   - BatchProcessing (from `batch_sitemap.py`) - Corresponds to "Batch Search" UI tab
   - DBPortal (from `db_portal.py`) - Admin/developer feature, not visible in main UI
   - DevTool (from `dev_tools.py`) - Admin/developer feature, not visible in main UI

4. **UI Feature Mapping**: Mapped the offending code's features to the UI tabs. "Batch Search" tab directly depends on the problematic `db_service.py`.

5. **Comprehensive Code Tracing**: Built a complete trace of the codebase using multiple approaches:
   - Static AST analysis (via `tools/run_full_trace.py`)
   - Router-specific tracing (via individual `tools/trace_deps_*.py` scripts)
   - Scheduler job analysis (via `tools/scheduler_trace.py`)
   - Dynamic import detection (via `tools/dynamic_imports.py`)

## 3. PENDING TASKS

1. **Resolve `db_service.py` Compatibility Issues**: The immediate task is to fix the linter error about `row_factory` parameter. Options:

   - A temporary fix that maintains the current architecture violation but resolves the immediate error
   - A comprehensive refactoring to replace the raw SQL approach with proper ORM usage

2. **Complete the Unused Code Audit**: Follow the process defined in `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md` to:

   - Review each file in `reports/unused_candidates.json`
   - Make definitive determinations about usage status
   - Archive confirmed unused code

3. **Refactor the Four Features Using `db_service.py`**: Plan and execute refactoring to eliminate usage of raw SQL in:
   - ContentMap (`modernized_sitemap.py` and related files)
   - BatchProcessing (`batch_sitemap.py` and related files)
   - DBPortal (`db_portal.py` and related files)
   - DevTool (`dev_tools.py` and related files)

## 4. KEY DOCUMENTS & RESOURCES

1. **Functional Dependency Map**: `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`

   - Maps each file to the features that use it
   - Confirms exactly which features depend on `db_service.py`

2. **Audit Methodology**: `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/Code_Audit_Methodology.md`

   - Detailed explanation of the tracing techniques used
   - Outlines the process for identifying unused code candidates

3. **Audit Process Guide**: `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md`

   - Step-by-step process for reviewing unused code candidates
   - Template for documenting decisions about each file

4. **Tracing Tools**:

   - `tools/run_full_trace.py`: Orchestrates the main trace and identifies unused candidates
   - `tools/trace_deps_*.py`: Individual scripts for feature-specific dependency tracing
   - `tools/build_functional_map.py`: Consolidates feature traces into the functional map

5. **Database Service Code**: `src/services/core/db_service.py`
   - Contains the problematic raw SQL query functionality
   - Currently has linter errors related to `row_factory` parameter usage

## 5. DATABASE SERVICE USAGE DETAILS

`db_service.py` provides these specific functions that the dependent features rely on:

1. **Connection Management**:

   - `get_connection()`
   - `get_cursor(row_factory=psycopg.rows.dict_row)`
   - `test_connection()`

2. **Raw SQL Query Execution**:

   - `fetch_one(query, params)`
   - `fetch_all(query, params)`
   - `execute(query, params)`
   - `execute_returning(query, params)`
   - `execute_batch(query, params_list)`
   - `execute_transaction(queries_and_params)`

3. **Database Introspection**:

   - `get_tables()`
   - `get_table_columns(table_name)`

4. **CRUD Operations**:
   - `get_record_by_id(table_name, record_id, tenant_id)`
   - `get_table_count(...)`
   - `json_contains(...)`
   - `create_record(table_name, data)`
   - `update_record(table_name, record_id, data, tenant_id)`
   - `delete_record(table_name, record_id, tenant_id)`

The four features use these functions in specific ways:

1. **ContentMap** (`modernized_sitemap.py`): Used for sitemap analysis and potentially corresponds to "Sitemap Curation" or "Results Viewer" in the UI.

2. **BatchProcessing** (`batch_sitemap.py`): Used for batch sitemap processing and corresponds directly to the "Batch Search" tab in the UI.

3. **DBPortal** (`db_portal.py`): Admin/developer interface for database operations, not visible in the main UI.

4. **DevTool** (`dev_tools.py`): Additional admin/developer tools, not visible in the main UI.

## 6. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Immediate Action**: Apply a temporary fix to `db_service.py` to resolve the linter error about `row_factory` parameter, using the direct replacement of the cursor creation line:

   ```python
   # cur = conn.cursor(row_factory=row_factory)  # This causes the linter error
   cursor = conn.cursor()  # Get a raw cursor
   cursor.row_factory = row_factory  # Set the row factory directly on the cursor
   ```

2. **Short-Term Plan**: Complete the unused code audit following `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md`.

3. **Medium-Term Plan**: Create tickets for refactoring each of the four features to eliminate their dependency on raw SQL:

   - Start with BatchProcessing ("Batch Search" tab) as it has a direct UI impact
   - Follow with ContentMap (potentially "Sitemap Curation")
   - Complete with the admin tools (DBPortal and DevTool)

4. **Long-Term Strategy**: After removing all dependencies on `db_service.py`, archive this file as part of the unused code cleanup.

The most critical aspect is to maintain a functioning application while gradually transitioning to ORM-only database access patterns.
