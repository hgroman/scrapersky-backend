# Analysis of Potentially Unused Files

This document provides a high-level analysis of the 24 files identified as potentially unused in the codebase, focusing on what they do and why they might be safe to archive.

## Overview by Category

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Database Layer | 5 | Files that violate standardized DB connection patterns |
| Auth Related | 2 | Authentication files that conflict with API gateway JWT approach |
| Models | 3 | Unused data models |
| Services | 11 | Unused service layers |
| Utilities | 3 | Miscellaneous utility files |
| Active Development | 2 | Files part of ongoing email refactoring work |

## Detailed Analysis

### Database Layer Files

| File | Description | Violates Architecture | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| `src/db/direct_migration.py` | Direct DB migration utilities | ‚úÖ | Uses direct DB connection instead of dependency injection |
| `src/db/direct_session.py` | Creates direct DB sessions | ‚úÖ | Bypasses FastAPI dependency injection pattern |
| `src/db/domain_handler.py` | Domain DB operations | ‚úÖ | Likely uses direct DB connection |
| `src/utils/db_schema_helper.py` | DB schema utilities | ‚ùì | Likely uses direct DB connection |
| `src/utils/db_utils.py` | DB helper functions | ‚úÖ | Potential direct DB connection pattern |

**Architectural Violation**: These files likely violate the mandatory requirement that "ONE AND ONLY ONE acceptable method for database connections: FastAPI dependency injection using get_session_dependency" should be used.

### Authentication Related

| File | Description | Violates Architecture | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| `src/auth/auth_service.py` | Authentication service | ‚úÖ | Likely violates JWT gateway-only architecture |
| `src/services/core/auth_service.py` | Core auth service | ‚úÖ | Duplicate auth service, violates architecture |

**Architectural Violation**: These files likely violate the principle that "JWT authentication happens ONLY at API gateway endpoints" while "database operations NEVER handle JWT or tenant authentication."

### Unused Models

| File | Description | Potential Replacement | Reason Unused |
|------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| `src/api/models/places.py` | API models for places | Main models in `src/models/` | Duplicate functionality |
| `src/models/feature_flag.py` | Feature flag models | Not implemented in app | Incomplete feature |
| `src/models/sidebar.py` | Sidebar UI models | Frontend handles this | Deprecated approach |

### Unused Services

| File | Purpose | Category | Probable Replacement |
|------|---------|----------|----------------------|
| `src/services/batch/task_debugger.py` | Debugging tool | Development | N/A - Dev tool |
| `src/services/db_inspector.py` | DB inspection | Development | N/A - Dev tool |
| `src/services/domain_service.py` | Domain operations | Core | Merged into another service |
| `src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py` | Adapter | Integration | Functionality moved elsewhere |
| `src/services/scraping/scrape_executor_service.py` | Scraping | Core | Replaced by modernized scrapers |
| `src/services/sitemap/analyzer_service.py` | Sitemap analysis | Core | Replaced by modernized version |
| `src/services/sitemap/background_service.py` | Background tasks | Core | Merged into main service |
| `src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py` | Sitemap handling | Core | Duplicate of `sitemap_service.py` |
| `src/services/sitemap_service.py` | Sitemap handling | Core | Duplicate, one is unused |
| `src/services/storage/storage_service.py` | Storage operations | Infrastructure | Unused storage layer |

### Miscellaneous Files

| File | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| `src/scraper/data_formatter.py` | Data formatting | Likely replaced by newer formatting |
| `src/utils/sidebar.py` | Sidebar utilities | Frontend now handles this |

### Active Development - DO NOT ARCHIVE

| File | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `src/schemas/contact.py` | Contact schemas | Referenced in email scraper refactoring (project-docs/29-Email-Scraper-Refactor) |
| `src/schemas/email_scan.py` | Email scan schemas | Explicitly mentioned in active Email Refactor project (project-docs/40-***Email-Scraper-Refactor-Round-2) |

## Architectural Violations Summary

The following chart summarizes how many files violate key architectural principles:

| Architectural Principle | Files Violating | Percentage of Unused Files |
|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Database Connection Standardization | 5 | 21% |
| JWT Auth at Gateway Only | 2 | 8% |
| API v3 Standardization | 1 | 4% |
| No Direct Session Creation | 5 | 21% |

## Risk Assessment for Removal

| Risk Level | Count | Files |
|------------|-------|-------|
| üü¢ Safe to Remove | 14 | Service duplicates, unused models, utils |
| üü° Verify First | 7 | DB-related files, auth services |
| üî¥ Hold - Active Development | 2 | `email_scan.py`, `contact.py` (active email work) |

## Recommendation

1. Start by archiving the 14 "Safe to Remove" files
2. Review the 7 "Verify First" files by checking for any dynamic imports
3. Do NOT archive the 2 email-related schema files (`src/schemas/contact.py` and `src/schemas/email_scan.py`) as they are part of active ongoing development work

**Important Note:** The email-related schemas were identified through static analysis because they might not be directly imported yet in the main application flow, but documentation confirms they are part of active development in progress.

This analysis indicates that the majority of identified files both appear unused and violate architectural principles, making them strong candidates for archiving.
