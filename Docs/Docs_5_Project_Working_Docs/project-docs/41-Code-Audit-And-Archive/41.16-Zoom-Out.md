# Project ScraperSky Audit: Zoom Out & Re-Engagement Plan

**Objective:** This document summarizes our recent progress, current status, and agreed-upon path forward for the ScraperSky code audit. It serves as a reference point to regain context and momentum after a break.

## Where We've Come From (Recent History)

1.  **Initial Goal:** We began with the primary objective of identifying and removing unused Python code from the ScraperSky backend codebase.
2.  **Methodology Development:** Realizing simple tools were insufficient, we undertook a significant effort to build a robust audit methodology. This involved:
    - Experimenting with static analysis tools (`pydeps`, `importlab`, basic AST).
    - Developing targeted dependency tracing scripts (`trace_deps_*.py`) for each API router (functional entry point).
    - Creating tools to trace scheduler jobs (`scheduler_trace.py`) and dynamic import patterns (`dynamic_imports.py`).
    - Consolidating all findings into a comprehensive `Docs/Docs_0_Architecture_and_Status/functional_dependency_map.json`.
    - Generating the primary list of potentially unused files: `reports/unused_candidates.json`.
    - Documenting this entire process extensively (see `41.11`, `41.12`, `41.5`, `Code_Audit_Methodology.md`).
3.  **The `psycopg` Roadblock:** During this process, an upgrade to the `psycopg` library (v3.x) introduced compatibility errors specifically linked to `src/services/core/db_service.py`'s handling of `row_factory`.
4.  **`db_service.py` Deep Dive:** Investigating the `psycopg` error led us to analyze `db_service.py`. We confirmed:
    - It uses raw SQL, bypassing the project's standard SQLAlchemy ORM approach.
    - It's a dependency for four distinct features: `ContentMap`, `BatchProcessing`, `DBPortal`, and `DevTool`.
    - This represents significant technical debt and architectural inconsistency.

## Where We Are Now (Current State - April 18th, 2024)

1.  **Critical Issue Identified:** We recognize `db_service.py` as the main blocker and source of current instability/errors. Quick patches proved ineffective.
2.  **Strategic Pause & Documentation:** We paused direct code modification of `db_service.py` to focus on understanding and planning. We completed key documentation:
    - `41.14-Handover-Document.md`: A concise summary of status, findings, pending tasks, and resources.
    - `41.15-***MICRO WORK ORDER...***`: Detailed steps to analyze the four features dependent on `db_service.py`.
    - `Technical & Strategic Snapshot` (Markdown doc): High-level assessment for broader context.
3.  **Defined Path:** We have a clear, agreed-upon plan to move forward, balancing the need for stability, addressing the core tech debt, and completing the original audit goal.

## Where We're Going (Plan Forward)

1.  **Stabilize (Optional but Recommended):** Ensure a stable baseline. If the `db_service.py` error prevents the server from running, apply the _minimal temporary fix_ (setting `cursor.row_factory = row_factory` after cursor creation in `get_cursor`) as noted in the Handover doc. Commit this stable state to Git and confirm it builds/deploys.
2.  **Analyze Dependencies (Top Priority):** Execute the `41.15-***MICRO WORK ORDER...***`. Systematically analyze how `BatchProcessing`, `ContentMap`, `DBPortal`, and `DevTool` use `db_service.py`. Document findings (SQL queries used, context, etc.). **This is the most critical next step.**
3.  **Audit Unused Code (Parallel Task):** Resume the original audit goal by processing `reports/unused_candidates.json`. Follow the steps in `41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md` to review files and document assessments. This can be done alongside or during breaks from the dependency analysis.
4.  **Refactor Features:** Based on the analysis from Step 2, plan and execute the refactoring of the four features to use the standard SQLAlchemy ORM. Prioritize based on impact (likely `BatchProcessing` first).
5.  **Eliminate `db_service.py`:** Once all dependencies are refactored, archive `src/services/core/db_service.py`.

## How to Re-Engage Effectively

- **Getting Back into Unused Code Identification:**

  - **Tooling Recap:** The core process relies on `tools/run_full_trace.py`. This script runs static analysis (AST from `main.py`), scheduler tracing, and dynamic pattern scanning. It compares the files identified through these methods against all `.py` files in `src/` to generate `reports/unused_candidates.json`.
  - **Your Action:** The primary action is to work through `reports/unused_candidates.json`. Use `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.13-Unused-Code-Audit.md` as your guide for reviewing each candidate file and documenting your decision (keep, investigate further, archive). This keeps the process structured and ensures we don't lose sight of the original goal. You can tackle this in manageable chunks.

- **Focusing on the Most Important Effort (`db_service.py`):**
  - **Why it's Critical:** It's causing instability _now_ and represents a major architectural violation blocking clean future development in related features.
  - **How to Stay Focused:** Use `41.15-***MICRO WORK ORDER...***` as your direct guide. Start with the first component listed (e.g., `BatchProcessing`). Open the relevant router/service files. Search for calls to `db_service` methods. Document _what_ raw SQL is being executed and _why_ (as best you can tell). This structured analysis prevents getting lost and directly feeds the necessary refactoring work.

**Summary:** The deep dive into methodology was successful â€“ it pinpointed the critical blocker (`db_service.py`). Now, use the Work Order (`41.15`) to analyze that blocker methodically. Use the Audit Guide (`41.13`) and `unused_candidates.json` to continue making progress on the cleanup goal in parallel. Establish a stable baseline first if needed. This balanced approach leverages our previous work and provides a clear path forward.
