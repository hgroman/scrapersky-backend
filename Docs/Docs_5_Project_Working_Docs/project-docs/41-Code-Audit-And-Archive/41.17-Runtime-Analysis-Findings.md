# Runtime Analysis Findings

## Objective

The goal of this document is to detail the process and findings from identifying the runtime-loaded `.py` files within the `/app/src` directory of the FastAPI application. This will help in understanding the application's behavior, optimizing code, and guiding further code audits.

## Attempt 1: Import Hook

We initially attempted to use a custom import hook (`RuntimeImportHook`) inserted into `sys.meta_path` to track imports. However, this approach failed because it couldn't reliably get the path of the user's source file performing the import. Specifically, `inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_code.co_filename` consistently returned internal Python import machinery paths (like `<frozen importlib._bootstrap>`) instead of the desired source file path (e.g., `/app/src/routers/domains.py`).

## Attempt 2: `sys.settrace`

To address the limitations of the import hook, we implemented a tracer using `sys.settrace`. This method involves registering a custom trace function that gets called by the Python interpreter for various events (like function calls) and inspects the execution frames to see which files are being accessed.

### Code Implementation

#### `src/config/runtime_tracer.py`

```python
import os
import threading
from typing import Set

# Global set to store loaded file paths from /app/src
LOADED_SRC_FILES: Set[str] = set()
_trace_lock = threading.Lock()

# Flag to control tracing
is_tracing_enabled = False

def trace_calls(frame, event, arg):
    """Trace function to be registered with sys.settrace."""
    if event == 'call':
        code = frame.f_code
        filename = code.co_filename
        # Check if the file is within /app/src and is a .py file
        try:
            abs_filename = os.path.abspath(filename)
            if abs_filename.startswith('/app/src/') and abs_filename.endswith('.py'):
                # Add to set (thread-safe)
                with _trace_lock:
                    LOADED_SRC_FILES.add(abs_filename)
        except Exception:
            # Ignore errors during path resolution/checking
            pass
    return trace_calls  # Return itself to continue tracing

def start_tracing():
    """Enable tracing."""
    global is_tracing_enabled
    if not is_tracing_enabled:
        print("Starting runtime file tracing...")
        sys.settrace(trace_calls)
        is_tracing_enabled = True
        # Enable tracing in all threads created from this point
        threading.settrace(trace_calls)

def stop_tracing():
    """Disable tracing."""
    global is_tracing_enabled
    if is_tracing_enabled:
        print("Stopping runtime file tracing...")
        sys.settrace(None)
        threading.settrace(None)  # Disable for threads as well
        is_tracing_enabled = False

def get_loaded_files() -> Set[str]:
    """Return the set of loaded files."""
    with _trace_lock:
        # Return a copy
        return set(LOADED_SRC_FILES)
```

#### `src/main.py`

```python
import logging
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from .config.runtime_tracer import start_tracing, stop_tracing, get_loaded_files

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# --- Lifespan Management ---

async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """Manages application startup and shutdown events."""
    logger.info("Starting up the ScraperSky API - Lifespan Start")
    # Start runtime file tracing
    # Do this early in startup
    start_tracing()
    # --- Add other startup logic here ---
    # Example: Initialize DB, scheduler, etc.
    # await initialize_database()
    # start_scheduler()
    # ------------------------------------
    yield  # Application runs here
    # --- Add shutdown logic here ---
    logger.info("Shutting down the ScraperSky API - Lifespan End")
    # Stop runtime file tracing
    stop_tracing()
    # Log the collected files on shutdown
    final_loaded_files = get_loaded_files()
    logger.info(f"Total unique /app/src/*.py files loaded: {len(final_loaded_files)}")
    for file_path in sorted(list(final_loaded_files)):
        logger.info(f"LOADED_SRC_FILE: {file_path}")
    # ------------------------------------

# --- FastAPI App Initialization ---
app = FastAPI(
    title="ScraperSky API",
    description="API for managing scraping tasks and data.",
    version="1.0.0",
    lifespan=lifespan  # Use the lifespan context manager
)

# --- Middleware ---
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Adjust in production
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# --- Routers ---
# Include your API routers here
# Example:
# app.include_router(domains.router, prefix="/api/v1/domains", tags=["Domains"])
# app.include_router(local_businesses.router, prefix="/api/v1/local-businesses", tags=["Local Businesses"])
# app.include_router(sitemap_files.router, prefix="/api/v1/sitemap-files", tags=["Sitemap Files"])

# --- Health Check Endpoint ---
@app.get("/health", tags=["Health"])
async def health_check():
    """Basic health check endpoint."""
    return {"status": "healthy"}

# --- Endpoint to retrieve loaded files ---
@app.get("/debug/loaded-src-files", tags=["Debug"], response_model=list)
async def get_loaded_src_files_endpoint():
    """Returns the list of unique /app/src/*.py files loaded during runtime."""
    files = get_loaded_files()
    return sorted(list(files))

# Note: No if __name__ == "__main__": block needed here if using uvicorn directly
# Uvicorn will import 'app' from this file.
```

### Key Finding: Eager Loading Behavior

We conducted an experiment to determine the loading behavior of the application. We restarted the server and queried `/debug/loaded-src-files` immediately after startup, without any user interaction. The list of files loaded just on startup was identical to the final, cumulative list obtained after clicking through all UI tabs and static pages in the earlier test run. Testing individual tabs after restarts also yielded the same list consistently.

#### Conclusion

The FastAPI application, primarily driven by the imports and router inclusions in `src/main.py`, loads the vast majority (if not all) of the Python code required for the features exposed in `scraper-sky-mvp.html` and its associated static pages during the initial startup process. Clicking through different UI tabs does not trigger the loading of new backend Python modules; the necessary code is already loaded.

#### Implication

This eager loading behavior simplifies the code audit process. Instead of exhaustively tracing each UI interaction, we can focus on the files loaded during startup. This reduces the scope of the audit and allows us to prioritize files that are not loaded at startup.

### Final Runtime Loaded File List

The definitive list of ~35 files captured immediately after startup serves as our baseline of "used by main app". This list includes all the files that are loaded during the initial startup process.

### Implications for Code Audit

1. **Simplification**: The eager loading behavior simplifies the code audit process by reducing the number of files to review.
2. **Focus Areas**:
   - **Files Not in Startup List**: Prioritize auditing files that are not in the startup list.
   - **Background Jobs**: Ensure that background jobs and scheduled tasks are correctly identified and audited.
   - **Manual Scripts**: Review any manual scripts or one-off scripts that might be used.
   - **Dead Code**: Use tools like `reports/unused_candidates.json` to identify and remove dead code.

### Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Auditing**: Focus on files that are not in the startup list and background jobs.
2. **Use Tools**: Utilize tools like `reports/unused_candidates.json` to identify unused code.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring to detect and address any new issues that arise.
