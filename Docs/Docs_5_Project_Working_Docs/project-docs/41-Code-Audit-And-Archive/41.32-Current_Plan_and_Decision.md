# Code Audit & Archive - Current Plan and Decision Point

**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Author:** Cursor AI / Hank Groman

**Purpose:** This document consolidates the current status of the ScraperSky Backend Code Audit & Archive project (Work Order 41 series) and outlines the immediate options and decisions required to move forward, providing a single point of reference for the next steps.

## 1. Current State Summary

- Following the "State of the Nation & Micro Work Order" (`41.30`), the exact contents of the existing archive directory (`_Archive_4.13.25/`) have been confirmed and documented in `41.31-final_archived_files.md`.
- This establishes the **Verified Baseline** of files currently considered archived as of this date.
- Previous efforts involved significant challenges, including flawed analysis, application instability after archiving attempts, and debugging cycles.
- Two main strategic threads emerged from previous planning:
  - **Verification Protocol (41.27/41.28):** A plan to rigorously verify the stability and correctness of the _current_ state (with files in `_Archive_4.13.25/` removed from `src/`).
  - **New Runtime Tracer (41.29):** An effort to develop and debug a _new_ runtime tracing tool for potentially more reliable future analysis, currently facing debugging hurdles (`41.29-progress.md`).

## 2. Immediate Goal

Confirm the stability and validity of the **current codebase state**, given the files listed in `41.31-final_archived_files.md` are archived (i.e., reside in `_Archive_4.13.25/` and are presumably absent from the active `src/` directory).

## 3. Actionable Options

Based on the current state and previous plans, we have two primary options for immediate action:

**Option A: Verify Current State (Based on 41.27 / 41.28 Protocol)**

- **Objective:** Confirm the application functions correctly with the currently archived files removed and understand the history of restored files.
- **Steps:**
  - **A.1:** Verify Application Functionality - Run the test suite (`pytest`).
  - **A.2:** Verify Application Functionality - Attempt server start-up (`uvicorn src.main:app --reload`).
  - **A.3:** Cross-Reference Restored Files - Compare `41.31-final_archived_files.md` against the initial candidate list (`project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/archived_code_candidates.md` - _Note: path needs verification_) to identify restored files and review documented reasons.
  - **A.4:** Synthesize Findings - Consolidate results to confirm the final state is stable and justified.

**Option B: Debug New Runtime Tracer (Based on 41.29 Plan)**

- **Objective:** Get the new runtime tracing tool operational for future code usage analysis.
- **Steps:**
  - **B.1:** Address known issues with the runtime tracer setup and data capture within the container environment (referencing `41.29-progress.md`).

## 4. Decision Needed

Which option should we prioritize _now_?

- **Choose Option A if:** The priority is to confirm the stability of the _current_ state and validate the existing archive _before_ potentially investing more time in new tooling. This builds confidence in the work done so far.
- **Choose Option B if:** The priority is to get the potentially superior analysis tool working, possibly deferring full validation of the current archive state until the new tool is functional. This might accelerate _future_ analysis but leaves the current state validation pending.

Please indicate which option (A or B) to pursue next.
