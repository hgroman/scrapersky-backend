# Archive Verification Results

**Date:** 2025-04-30
**Verified Archive:** `_Archive_4.13.25/` contents as documented in `41.31-final_archived_files.md`

## Application Startup Test

- **Status:** Success
- **Command:** `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
- **Observations:** Server started without import errors. Standard startup logs observed. Connection to Supabase pooler established.

## Automated Tests

- **Status:** Failure
- **Command:** `pytest`
- **Test Results:** Test collection failed. 1 error reported: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_or_create_domain' from 'src.services.page_scraper.domain_processor'` in `tests/test_single_domain_scanner.py`. 21 unrelated warnings also noted.

## Conclusion

Based on these verification tests, the current archive state is:

- **Unstable**
- **Requires remediation**

## Next Steps

- **Requires remediation:** The `ImportError` during test collection needs investigation. It suggests a dependency issue potentially related to the current archive state, specifically affecting `src.services.page_scraper.domain_processor` or its usage in tests. Further analysis is needed to determine if a file needs to be restored from the archive or if there's another code issue.
