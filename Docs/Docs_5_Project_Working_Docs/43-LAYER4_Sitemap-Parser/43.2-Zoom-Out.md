Okay, starting fresh. Here's a summary of where we are:

1.  **Goal:** We've been working to get the "Sitemap Import" workflow (formerly called "Deep Scrape", Workflow 06) running correctly. The goal of this workflow is to take a `SitemapFile` record marked as `Queued`, fetch the sitemap XML from its URL, parse the page URLs listed within it, and save those page URLs into the `pages` database table.

2.  **Refactoring:** We renamed the primary files involved from `deep_scrape_scheduler.py` and `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` to `sitemap_import_scheduler.py` and `sitemap_import_service.py`, along with relevant classes, functions, and settings variables in `settings.py` to better reflect the "Sitemap Import" task.

3.  **Debugging:** We fixed numerous issues:

    - Missing files (`sitemap_parser.py`, `__init__.py` in `src/common`, other service/SDK files added earlier by you).
    - Multiple `ModuleNotFoundError` and `ImportError` issues.
    - Incorrect Enum usage (`Failed` vs. `Error`).
    - Incorrect scheduler setup logic (fixed to use the shared scheduler instance).
    - `AttributeError` related to settings loading timing (fixed by importing `settings` inside functions).
    - `AttributeError` caused by mismatch between the model attribute name (`deep_scrape_process_status` in `sitemap.py`) and the name used in the service code (`deep_scrape_status` in `sitemap_import_service.py`). We fixed the service code to use the correct attribute name (`deep_scrape_process_status`).
    - An `AssertionError` during startup caused by a naming conflict between `pathlib.Path` and `fastapi.Path` in `dev_tools.py`.

4.  **Testing Endpoint:** We created a developer testing endpoint (`POST /api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/{sitemap_file_id}`) in `src/routers/dev_tools.py` to manually trigger the import process for a specific `SitemapFile` ID, bypassing the scheduler wait time.

5.  **Current Status:**
    - The server (`scrapersky` container) is currently running.
    - We successfully called the test endpoint (`POST /api/v3/dev-tools/trigger-sitemap-import/2803a8f3-5745-40c0-8359-9c5c14360f5d`) using `curl`.
    - The `curl` command returned a success message: `{"message":"Sitemap import process triggered successfully.","sitemap_file_id":"2803a8f3-5745-40c0-8359-9c5c14360f5d"}`. This indicates the immediate `AttributeError` is resolved and the service function executed without crashing.
    - **Outstanding Naming Inconsistency:** While we renamed files/classes/settings, the actual database column names (`deep_scrape_process_status`, `deep_scrape_error`) and the corresponding attributes in the `SitemapFile` model (`src/models/sitemap.py`) still use the old "deep_scrape" names. You've insisted we fix this completely.

**Immediate Next Step:** Verify the outcome of the successful `curl` test by checking the application logs and the database (`pages` table for new entries, `sitemap_files` table for status update to 'Completed').
