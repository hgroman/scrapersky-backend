**1. Objective**

- Conduct a comprehensive audit of all background task initiation and execution patterns currently implemented in the backend.
- Identify any deviations from the established standard architectural pattern (APScheduler polling database status columns via shared scheduler instance).
- Specifically analyze the Email Extraction background task (`ContactLaunchpad` workflow, likely involving `email_scanner.py` and `email_scraper.py`) for adherence to the standard pattern, including proper session and transaction management.
- Produce a clear inventory of background tasks, their implementation patterns, and identify candidates requiring refactoring to align with project standards.

**2. Background & Context**

Recent debugging efforts (Ref: `project-docs/29-*`, `project-docs/36-*`) highlighted potential inconsistencies and fragility introduced when background task implementations deviate from the project's established standards ([Guide 21](Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/21-SCHEDULED_TASKS_APSCHEDULER_PATTERN.md), [Guide 24](Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/24-SHARED_SCHEDULER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)). Specifically, the Email Extraction workflow was subject to refactoring attempts that may have diverged from these standards, leading to significant debugging challenges. The high-level mapping of expected background jobs to features is outlined in `0.1_ScraperSky_Architecture_Flow_and_Components.md`.

Previous work orders (e.g., `20.1-Work-Order.md`) established the necessity of proper separation of concerns and dedicated session/transaction management ([Guide 13](Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/13-TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md)) for background tasks to ensure stability. Furthermore, the reliability of the standard status polling mechanism depends heavily on the consistent use of standardized Enum values, as addressed in `31.1-Work-Order.md`.

To ensure system stability, maintainability, and predictability, all background processing must adhere to the documented patterns. This audit aims to identify and document any non-compliant implementations, starting with the Email Extraction flow, to enable targeted refactoring efforts.

**3. Requirements**

1.  **Identify All Background Task Entry Points:**
    - Analyze `src/schedulers/` to list all scheduled jobs managed by APScheduler.
    - Analyze `src/routers/` and relevant `src/services/` for any usage of FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` for initiating potentially long-running or database-intensive operations.
2.  **Analyze Trigger Mechanisms:**
    - For each scheduled job, document which database table(s) and status column(s) it polls.
    - For each `BackgroundTasks` usage, document how the task is initiated (e.g., direct API call response).
3.  **Analyze Task Execution Logic:**
    - For each identified task (whether triggered by scheduler or `BackgroundTasks`), locate the primary execution code (e.g., function/method in a service or task module).
    - Analyze how database sessions are obtained and managed within the task's execution context (e.g., dedicated session per task, dependency injection, transaction handling).
4.  **Categorize Implementation Pattern:**
    - For each task, determine if it adheres to the standard pattern:
      - **Standard:** Triggered by APScheduler polling a DB status column; uses appropriate session/transaction management (e.g., dedicated session like `process_domain_with_own_session`, or relies correctly on calling router's transaction if applicable).
      - **Non-Standard:** Triggered differently (e.g., direct `BackgroundTasks` from API without status polling) OR uses non-standard/incorrect session/transaction handling.
5.  **Detailed Email Extraction Analysis:**
    - Specifically trace the Email Extraction workflow (likely initiated via `email_scanner.py` API, potentially executing via `email_scraper.py` task).
    - Document its trigger mechanism, execution logic, session/transaction handling, and categorize its adherence to the standard pattern. Identify specific areas needing potential refactoring.

**4. Deliverables**

1.  **Background Task Audit Report:** A new document (e.g., `project-docs/39-Background-Task-Audit/39.1-Audit-Report.md`) containing:
    - A table listing all identified background tasks/jobs.
    - Columns for: Task Name/Purpose, Trigger Mechanism (Scheduler/Polling Target OR API/BackgroundTasks), Code Location (Scheduler func, Task func), Standard Pattern Compliant (Yes/No + Rationale if No), Session/Transaction Handling Notes.
2.  **Email Extraction Refactor Plan:** A section within the Audit Report (or a separate document like `39.2-Email-Extraction-Plan.md`) detailing the findings for the Email Extraction task and outlining specific, actionable steps required (if any) to bring it into full compliance with the standard pattern.

**5. Proposed Process**

1.  AI analyzes the codebase (`schedulers`, `routers`, `services`, `tasks`) to fulfill Requirements 1-3.
2.  AI produces the Background Task Audit Report (Deliverable 1), including categorization (Requirement 4) and the specific Email Extraction analysis (Requirement 5).
3.  User reviews the Audit Report and Refactor Plan.
4.  Based on the review, prioritize and plan subsequent work orders for refactoring any non-standard tasks identified, starting with Email Extraction if needed.

**6. Acceptance Criteria**

- The Audit Report accurately inventories all significant background processing tasks and their implementation details (trigger, pattern, session handling).
- The report clearly categorizes each task's adherence to the standard pattern.
- The analysis of the Email Extraction task is complete, and necessary refactoring steps (if any) are clearly outlined.
