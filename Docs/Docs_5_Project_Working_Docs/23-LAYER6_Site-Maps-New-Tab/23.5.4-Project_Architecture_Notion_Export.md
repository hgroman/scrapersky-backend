# Project Architecture & Workflow

---

## Overview
This system integrates a back-end FastAPI server with both static HTML/JavaScript and a production-grade React UI (Luvable). It handles enriched data pipelines, automated deployments, and a spiritual, purpose-driven development ethos.

---

## 1. Tech Stack

### Front-End
- **Dev UI:** Static HTML + JavaScript
  - Individual JS files for each FastAPI endpoint
  - Renders dynamic, paginated grids
- **Prod UI:** Luvable (React)
  - Google login
  - Future AI-assisted UI from OpenAPI

### Back-End
- **FastAPI + SQLAlchemy**
  - RESTful API + static content hosting
  - OpenAPI docs for introspection
- **Supabase**
  - Structured storage of enriched data
- **Render.com**
  - Git-based deployment

### Tooling
- **Cursor IDE (Mac)** for local dev
- **Docker + GitHub** for orchestration and CI/CD

---

## 2. Workflow

### Development
- Code in Cursor IDE
- FastAPI serves local static files for JS testing
- Push to GitHub triggers deployment to Render

### Data Enrichment Pipeline
1. Google Business scraping
2. Domain resolution, homepage fetch
3. Sitemap & metadata parsing
4. Store in Supabase

---

## 3. Deployment

- FastAPI deployed via Render.com
- Front-end on Luvable (Vercel)
- GitHub manages source control + CI

---

## 4. Future Vision

### AI Integration
- OpenAPI + JavaScript docs used to auto-generate UI components
- Modular AI assistant with:
  - Executive dashboards
  - Persona-based guidance
  - Semantic matchmaking between goals & tech

### Spiritual Alignment
- Kingdom Tech Manifesto:
  - REST mirrors Sabbath
  - Data integrity reflects truth
  - Interface design as divine hospitality

---

## Suggested Enhancements
- Auto-generate JS fetch functions from OpenAPI
- Add analytics (PostHog, simple log tracking)
- CI/CD improvements: add GitHub Actions
- Modular AI Blueprint (Executive Assistant, Persona Engine)
