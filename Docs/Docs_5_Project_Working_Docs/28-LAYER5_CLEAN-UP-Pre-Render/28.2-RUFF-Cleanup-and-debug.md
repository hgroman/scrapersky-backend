# Ruff Cleanup - Micro Plan

**STATUS: PAUSED / BLOCKED**

**Reason:** Blocked pending completion of the Email Scraper refactor (Work Order `29.1-Work-Order-Email-Scraper-Refactor`). Many Ruff issues identified are within `src/routers/email_scanner.py` and `src/tasks/email_scraper.py` and will be addressed during that refactor.

---

This plan details the steps to address the 2502 Ruff linting issues identified after the initial unused import fixes.

**Goal:** Resolve all critical errors and significantly reduce other linting warnings before staging Git changes.

**Priority:** Fix functional errors (`F821`) first, then handle autofixable issues, then manually address style/warning issues.

## Steps:

1.  **Fix Critical Error (`F821` Undefined Name):**

    - **File:** `src/tasks/email_scraper.py` (around line 132)
    - **Issue:** Code references `Website`, which is undefined.
    - **Action:** Investigate the surrounding code. Determine if `Website` should be imported (find the correct model), replaced with a different variable, or if the entire code block is obsolete and should be removed. Apply the necessary fix.

2.  **Apply Autofixes (with Confirmation):**

    - **Issue:** Remaining unused imports (`F401`), potentially other autofixable rules.
    - **Proposed Action:**
      - Run `ruff check . --diff` to **preview** changes.
      - **Confirm** approval of the diff.
      - Run `ruff check . --fix` to **apply** the confirmed changes.
    - **Rationale:** Efficiently removes remaining unused code identified by Ruff.

3.  **Address Unused Variables (`F841`) and Loop Variables (`B007`):**

    - **Action:** Manually review each reported instance.
      - For `F841`: Remove the entire assignment line if the variable is truly unused.
      - For `B007`: Rename the loop variable to `_` or `_variable_name` (e.g., `_i` or `_name`).

4.  **Refactor Exception Handling (`B904`, `E722`):**

    - **Action:** Manually review each reported instance.
      - For `B904`: Modify `raise Exception(...)` within `except` blocks to `raise Exception(...) from e` (where `e` is the caught exception variable) or `raise Exception(...) from None`.
      - For `E722`: Change `except:` to `except Exception:` to catch specific exceptions rather than everything (including system exits).

5.  **Fix Line Lengths (`E501`):**

    - **Action:** Manually review the lines reported as too long. Wrap long lines appropriately (e.g., inside parentheses, brackets, braces, or using backslashes for string concatenation if necessary) to conform to the 88-character limit. Prioritize readability.

6.  **Final Ruff Check:**

    - **Action:** Run `ruff check .` again.
    - **Goal:** Verify that all or most errors have been resolved. Address any remaining issues.

7.  **Optional: Run Vulture:**
    - **Action:** Run `vulture src/ --min-confidence 80` (or adjust confidence).
    - **Goal:** Perform a broader scan for potentially dead code (functions, classes) that Ruff might miss. Review Vulture's report carefully, as it can sometimes have false positives. Manually remove confirmed dead code.
