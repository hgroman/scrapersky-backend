# Git Commit Checklist (Post Sitemap Refactor & Enum Fix)

**Date:** 2024-07-27

This checklist separates the files directly modified during the sitemap refactoring and enum isolation work (which are likely safe to commit) from all other files that show changes in `git status`. **Carefully review the "Other Changed Files" section before committing.**
