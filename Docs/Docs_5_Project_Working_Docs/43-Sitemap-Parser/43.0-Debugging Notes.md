**Detailed Session Summary:**

1.  **Initial Goal: Reset Project**

    - **Your Request:** Reset the project to the last Git commit due to concerns about recent "messy results". You asked for a diff first to understand the impact.
    - **Action:** Ran `git diff HEAD | cat`.
    - **Observation:** The diff showed numerous lines removed (marked with `-`) from `src/storage/storage_service.py`. This was clarified to mean these lines were _added_ since the last commit, not removed from the commit itself. Specifically, methods like `store_sitemap_data`, `store_places_data`, `store_contact_data`, `get_domain_data`, and their helpers appeared to be new additions.
    - **Action:** Ran `git diff HEAD --name-only | cat` to identify all changed files.
    - **Observation:** A large number of files were listed, including many documentation files under `Docs/`, archive files, `docker-compose.yml`, `requirements.txt`, and several `src/` files (`config/settings.py`, `main.py`, `services/core/db_service.py`, `services/sitemap/processing_service.py`, `services/storage/storage_service.py`).
    - **Conclusion:** Resetting would discard all changes in these listed files, including the newly added storage service functionality.

2.  **Shift to Understanding Project State & Documentation**

    - **Your Request:** Analyze `train-wreck.md`.
    - **Action:** Reviewed the document.
    - **Observation:** Identified `train-wreck.md` as a detailed handoff/post-mortem. Key findings included:
      - A critical crash in Workflow 6 (WF-06) due to a missing `PageScrapeStatusEnum` in both code (`src/models/page.py`) and the database (no migration).
      - Recognition that documentation (workflow traces) had diverged from the actual codebase and couldn't be trusted without verification.
      - Missing files and logic in other workflows (WF-02, WF-03, WF-05).
      - A proposed recovery plan focusing on fixing WF-06 first, verifying traces, and then addressing other gaps.
    - **Action:** Reviewed `train-wreck-bright-side-per-deepseek.md`.
    - **Observation:** Confirmed it was a good, concise summary of the `train-wreck.md` recovery plan, highlighting the Enum fix, migration, and trace verification as top priorities.

3.  **Attempting to Start the Server (Iterative Debugging with "Code 7")**

    - **Your Request:** Restart the server (`scrapersky` service in `docker-compose.yml`), check health, check logs. We established the "Code 7" command for this sequence: `docker compose restart scrapersky && sleep 20 && curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "Health check failed..." && docker compose logs scrapersky | cat`.
    - **Code 7 - Attempt 1:**
      - _Result:_ Health check failed (`curl: (7) Failed to connect...`).
      - _Logs:_ Showed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.services.deep_scrape_scheduler'` during Uvicorn startup, triggered by `from .services.deep_scrape_scheduler import setup_deep_scrape_scheduler` in `src/main.py`.
    - **Code 7 - Attempt 2 (After you added `deep_scrape_scheduler.py`):**
      - _Result:_ Health check failed.
      - _Logs:_ Showed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.common.curation_sdk'`, triggered by `from src.common.curation_sdk.scheduler_loop import run_job_loop` within the new `deep_scrape_scheduler.py`.
    - **Code 7 - Attempt 3 (After you added `scheduler_loop.py` to `src/common/curation_sdk/`):**
      - _Result:_ Health check failed.
      - _Logs:_ Showed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.models.sitemap_file'`, triggered by `from src.models.sitemap_file import SitemapDeepScrapeStatusEnum, SitemapFile` within `deep_scrape_scheduler.py`.

4.  **Analyzing Model/Schema Files**

    - **Your Request:** Compare `src/models/sitemap.py` and `src/models/sitemap_file.py`.
    - **Action:** Explained the difference: `sitemap.py` contains SQLAlchemy database models (mapping to tables), while `sitemap_file.py` contains Pydantic API schemas (for data validation/transfer). Confirmed their location in `src/models/` was conventional.

5.  **Refining Imports in `deep_scrape_scheduler.py`**

    - **Code 7 - Attempt 4:** (Triggered by previous `ModuleNotFoundError` for `sitemap_file`)
      - _Result:_ Health check failed.
      - _Logs:_ Showed `ImportError: cannot import name 'SitemapDeepScrapeStatusEnum' from 'src.models.sitemap_file'`. This confirmed the import path was wrong.
    - **Action:** Edited `src/services/deep_scrape_scheduler.py` to change the problematic import from `src.models.sitemap_file` to `from src.models.sitemap import SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum, SitemapFile`.
    - **Observation:** Linter reported new errors after the edit:
      - `Import "src.services.sitemap_deep_scrape_service" could not be resolved`.
      - `Cannot access attribute "Failed" for class "type[SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum]"`.
      - Several errors indicating `DEEP_SCRAPE_SCHEDULER_...` attributes were not known in `src.config.settings`.
    - **Action:** Checked `src/config/settings.py`.
    - **Observation:** Confirmed that `DEEP_SCRAPE_SCHEDULER_...` settings _were_ defined, meaning those specific linter errors were incorrect/outdated.
    - **Action:** Edited `src/services/deep_scrape_scheduler.py` again:
      - Changed `failed_status=SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum.Failed` to `failed_status=SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum.Error`.
      - Tried changing the import for `SitemapDeepScrapeService` to relative (`.sitemap_deep_scrape_service`). Linter still failed.
      - Reverted the import back to absolute (`src.services.sitemap_deep_scrape_service`). Linter still failed.
    - **Action:** Ran `ls src/services/`.
    - **Observation:** Confirmed `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` was not present in that directory.
    - **Code 7 - Attempt 5 (After you added `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py`):**
      - _Result:_ Health check failed.
      - _Logs:_ Showed the error predicted by `train-wreck.md`: `ImportError: cannot import name 'PageScrapeStatusEnum' from 'src.models.page'`, triggered by line 13 of the new `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py`.

6.  **Current Status:**

    - We have successfully resolved several layers of import errors by adding missing files (`deep_scrape_scheduler.py`, `scheduler_loop.py`, `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py`) and correcting import paths/enum usage within `deep_scrape_scheduler.py`.
    - The server startup is now failing due to the missing `PageScrapeStatusEnum`, which needs to be defined (likely in `src/models/enums.py`) and then imported correctly in `src/services/sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` (and potentially `src/models/page.py`). This aligns exactly with the primary blocker identified in the initial documentation review.

7.  **Workflow Scope Clarification & Final Service Fixes:**

    - **Clarification:** Established that WF-06 (Sitemap Deep Scrape) scope is _only_ to parse sitemap files and insert the extracted URLs into the `pages` table. It does **not** involve scraping individual pages or tracking page-level status (that's for WF-07).
    - **Correction:** Realized the `ImportError` for `PageScrapeStatusEnum` in `sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` was due to the code incorrectly assuming page-level status tracking was part of WF-06.
    - **Action:** Edited `src/services/sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` multiple times to:
      - Remove the import and usage of the non-existent `PageScrapeStatusEnum`.
      - Correctly import `SitemapFile`, `SitemapUrl`, and `SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum` from `src.models.sitemap`.
      - Ensure the service uses `SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum` (`.Completed`, `.Error`) when updating the status of the parent `SitemapFile`.
    - **Remaining Issues:** Linter still shows type hinting errors related to assigning `None` or `str` to `SitemapFile.deep_scrape_error`. These might not be runtime errors.

8.  **Next Step:** Attempt to start the server again (**Code 7**) to see if the primary import/logic errors are resolved.

9.  **Scheduler Initialization Correction:**

    - **Initial Error:** Logs showed `TypeError: setup_deep_scrape_scheduler() missing 1 required positional argument: 'scheduler'` originating from the call in `src/main.py`.
    - **Initial Assumption:** Assumed `main.py` needed to pass the `scheduler` instance to the setup function.
    - **Documentation Review:** Reviewed architecture docs (`10-architectural-patterns/01...`, `20.1-Word-Order.md`, `21.1-Supplemental.md`).
    - **Corrected Understanding:** Identified that the project was refactored to use a **single, shared scheduler instance** defined in `src/scheduler_instance.py`. The correct pattern is for each `setup_<service>_scheduler` function (in the respective service file) to _import_ this shared instance and use it directly, rather than accepting it as an argument. The calls in `main.py` (without arguments) are actually correct according to this pattern.
    - **Revised Diagnosis:** The `TypeError` indicates that the function _definition_ of `setup_deep_scrape_scheduler` in `src/services/deep_scrape_scheduler.py` is incorrect, as it likely still expects a `scheduler` argument based on an older pattern.

10. **Revised Next Step:** Modify the function definition of `setup_deep_scrape_scheduler` in `src/services/deep_scrape_scheduler.py` to remove the `scheduler` parameter and instead import and use the shared instance from `src.scheduler_instance`.

11. **Next Step:** Refactor the WF-06 components to use clearer naming.

12. **Naming Refactor (Deep Scrape -> Sitemap Import):**

    - **Reasoning:** Based on the clarified scope of WF-06 (extracting URLs from sitemaps, not scraping pages), the term "Deep Scrape" was confusing.
    - **Action:** Renamed components for clarity:
      - Files:
        - `src/services/deep_scrape_scheduler.py` -> `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py`
        - `src/services/sitemap_deep_scrape_service.py` -> `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`
      - Scheduler (`sitemap_import_scheduler.py`):
        - Function `process_pending_deep_scrapes` -> `process_pending_sitemap_imports`
        - Function `setup_deep_scrape_scheduler` -> `setup_sitemap_import_scheduler`
        - `job_id` changed to `"process_sitemap_imports"`
        - Job `name` changed to `"Process Pending Sitemap Imports"`
        - Import updated to `src.services.sitemap_import_service.SitemapImportService`
      - Service (`sitemap_import_service.py`):
        - Class `SitemapDeepScrapeService` -> `SitemapImportService`
      - Main (`main.py`):
        - Import updated to `from src.services.sitemap_import_scheduler import setup_sitemap_import_scheduler`
        - Function call updated to `setup_sitemap_import_scheduler()`
    - **Note:** Database field names (`deep_scrape_status`, `deep_scrape_error`) and the Enum (`SitemapDeepProcessStatusEnum`) were _not_ renamed yet as this requires migrations. Settings variable names (`DEEP_SCRAPE_...`) were also left unchanged for now.
    - **Current Status:** Files and code refactored. Ready to test.

13. **Final Startup Error & Missing File:**

    - **Action:** Ran Code 7 (restart, wait, health check, wait, logs) with refactored code.
    - **Observation:** Server failed to start.
    - **Action:** Ran targeted restart & log check (`docker compose restart ... && sleep 5 && docker compose logs ...`).
    - **Error:** Logs showed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.common.sitemap_parser'`, originating from the import `from src.common.sitemap_parser import SitemapParser, SitemapURL` in `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py` (line 12).
    - **Investigation:**
      - Confirmed `src/common/sitemap_parser.py` was the _intended_ location via code search.
      - Checked `src/common/` directory contents via `ls`. Confirmed `sitemap_parser.py` is missing.
      - Checked `src/scraper/` directory contents via `ls`. Confirmed `sitemap_parser.py` was not moved there.
    - **Conclusion:** The file `src/common/sitemap_parser.py`, containing the crucial `SitemapParser` class needed for WF-06, is missing from the project.
    - **Current Status:** Blocked. Cannot proceed until `src/common/sitemap_parser.py` is restored.

14. **Restoring Parser & Fixing Settings Mismatch:**
    - **Action:** Created `src/common/sitemap_parser.py` (using provided code) and `src/common/__init__.py` to make `src/common` a package.
    - **Action:** Ran quick restart & log check.
    - **Observation:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.common.sitemap_parser'` was resolved.
    - **Error:** Server startup failed with `AttributeError: module 'src.config.settings' has no attribute 'DEEP_SCRAPE_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES'` in `sitemap_import_scheduler.py`.
    - **Reason:** Realized the refactor (Step 12) renamed files/classes but not the corresponding settings variables.
    - **Action:** Renamed settings variables in `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py` to use `SITEMAP_IMPORT_...` prefix.
    - **Action:** Reviewed `src/common/curation_sdk/scheduler_loop.py` to find correct parameters for `run_job_loop`.
    - **Action:** Corrected the call to `run_job_loop` in `sitemap_import_scheduler.py` (removed invalid params, added `order_by_column`).
    - **Observation:** Linter showed type mismatch for `processing_function` argument in `run_job_loop`.
    - **Action:** Corrected parameter order in `SitemapImportService.process_single_sitemap_file` definition (`sitemap_file_id` first, `session` second).
    - **Observation:** Linter showed errors assigning `None`/`str` to `SitemapFile.deep_scrape_error` and accessing `.url` on `SitemapURL`.
    - **Action:** Updated `SitemapFile` model (`src/models/sitemap.py`) to make `deep_scrape_error: Mapped[Optional[str]]`.
    - **Action:** Updated `SitemapImportService` (`src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`) to use `sitemap_url_record.loc` instead of `.url`. Ignored persistent (likely cached) linter errors about `deep_scrape_error`.
    - **Action:** Renamed corresponding settings fields in `src/config/settings.py` from `DEEP_SCRAPE_...` to `SITEMAP_IMPORT_...`. Alerted user that corresponding environment variables in `.env`/`docker-compose.yml` also need updating.
    - **Action:** Ran Code 7 (restart, wait, health check, wait, logs).
    - **Observation:** Server started successfully! No `AttributeError`. Logs show scheduler running other jobs. `process_sitemap_imports` job was added correctly. No logs yet from the job itself (expected, as nothing is queued).
    - **Current Status:** Refactoring complete, server starts cleanly. Ready for functional testing (queuing a SitemapFile and monitoring).
