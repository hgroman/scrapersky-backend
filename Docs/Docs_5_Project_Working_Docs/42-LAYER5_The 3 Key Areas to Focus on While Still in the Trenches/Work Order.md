Architecture Thinking
→ “How systems scale, integrate, and stay modular.”
While you're building hands-on, it's the ideal moment to ensure your foundational architecture avoids spaghetti growth. This means:

Enforcing clean interfaces between modules

Anticipating future integrations (even if they're stubs today)

Avoiding “just for now” shortcuts that become bottlenecks

Data Strategy
→ “How you structure, enrich, and move data across your ecosystem.”
It’s easy to just pipe data in and store it. But now is the moment to define:

What makes your data trustable, valuable, and interoperable

Which records should have metadata attached (source, confidence, freshness)

How that data will later support decision-making layers and dashboards

AI Orchestration Readiness
→ “How different models, agents, or workflows will talk to each other.”
Don’t wait to think about how AI will “plug in.” Use this time to:

Tag places in your pipeline where AI could offer leverage (summarizing, scoring, classifying)

Think through the handoffs between logic and learning

Design AI layers that augment you, not replace your core judgment

These weren’t just technical suggestions—they were founder leverage opportunities.
The idea was: while you still have your hands on the code, bake in the strategic patterns you’ll need later—before they become harder to retrofit.
