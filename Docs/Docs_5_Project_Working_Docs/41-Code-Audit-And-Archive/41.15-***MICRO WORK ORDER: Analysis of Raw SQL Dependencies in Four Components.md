<think>
I need to create a detailed micro work order to analyze the four components that use the non-compliant `db_service.py`. The work order should be specific about what to analyze in each file and what information to gather to eventually help refactor these components away from raw SQL usage.

For each component, I should include:

1. What files to examine (router files and their dependencies)
2. What specific database operations to look for
3. What to document about their usage
4. What potential ORM replacements might look like

The goal is to give clear instructions for a thorough analysis that will enable the eventual refactoring of these components.

# MICRO WORK ORDER: Analysis of Raw SQL Dependencies in Four Components

## OBJECTIVE

Analyze how each of the four identified components uses `db_service.py`, documenting specific raw SQL operations and gathering information to facilitate future refactoring to ORM-based approaches.

## COMPONENTS FOR ANALYSIS

### 1. ContentMap Component (`src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py`)

**Files to Examine:**

- `src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py` (entry point)
- All dependencies traced in `reports/deps_modernized_sitemap.json`
- Focus on service files referenced by the router

**Analysis Tasks:**

1. Identify all methods calling `db_service.py` functions
2. Document each raw SQL query string, noting:
   - SQL operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Target tables and columns
   - Join conditions and WHERE clauses
   - Parameters passed to queries
3. Map each query to the corresponding API endpoint/function
4. Identify any database models (`src/models/*.py`) that correspond to the tables queried
5. Note any complex SQL operations that might be challenging to convert to ORM (JSON operations, complex joins, etc.)

**Deliverables:**

- Spreadsheet mapping each `db_service` call to:
  - Source file and function
  - SQL operation details
  - Equivalent SQLAlchemy model classes
  - Potential ORM replacement approach

### 2. BatchProcessing Component (`src/routers/batch_sitemap.py`)

**Files to Examine:**

- `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py` (entry point)
- All dependencies traced in `reports/deps_batch_sitemap.json`
- Focus on `src/services/batch/batch_sitemap_service.py`

**Analysis Tasks:**

1. Identify all methods calling `db_service.py` functions
2. Document each raw SQL query string, noting:
   - SQL operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Target tables and columns
   - Join conditions and WHERE clauses
   - Parameters passed to queries
3. Map each query to the UI action in the "Batch Search" tab
4. Identify any database models (`src/models/*.py`) that correspond to the tables queried
5. Note batch processing specifics that might require specialized ORM patterns

**Deliverables:**

- Spreadsheet mapping each `db_service` call to:
  - Source file and function
  - SQL operation details
  - UI action triggering the operation
  - Equivalent SQLAlchemy model classes
  - Potential ORM replacement approach

### 3. DBPortal Component (`src/routers/db_portal.py`)

**Files to Examine:**

- `src/routers/db_portal.py` (entry point)
- All dependencies traced in `reports/deps_db_portal.json`
- Focus on `src/services/db_portal_service.py`

**Analysis Tasks:**

1. Identify all methods calling `db_service.py` functions
2. Document each raw SQL query string, noting:
   - SQL operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Target tables and columns
   - Join conditions and WHERE clauses
   - Parameters passed to queries
3. Determine if DBPortal's functionality is specifically related to raw SQL execution (e.g., is it a SQL execution portal?)
4. Identify any database models (`src/models/*.py`) that correspond to the tables queried
5. If DBPortal is primarily for SQL execution, document if/how it might need to be redesigned entirely

**Deliverables:**

- Spreadsheet mapping each `db_service` call to:
  - Source file and function
  - SQL operation details
  - Equivalent SQLAlchemy model classes
  - Recommendation for refactoring (standard ORM vs. alternative approach)

### 4. DevTool Component (`src/routers/dev_tools.py`)

**Files to Examine:**

- `src/routers/dev_tools.py` (entry point)
- All dependencies traced in `reports/deps_dev_tools.json`
- Focus on service files referenced by this router

**Analysis Tasks:**

1. Identify all methods calling `db_service.py` functions
2. Document each raw SQL query string, noting:
   - SQL operation type (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Target tables and columns
   - Join conditions and WHERE clauses
   - Parameters passed to queries
3. Determine the nature of the developer tools and their specific requirements
4. Identify any database models (`src/models/*.py`) that correspond to the tables queried
5. Assess whether these tools might need direct SQL execution capabilities

**Deliverables:**

- Spreadsheet mapping each `db_service` call to:
  - Source file and function
  - SQL operation details
  - Dev tool purpose/function
  - Equivalent SQLAlchemy model classes
  - Recommendation for refactoring (standard ORM vs. alternative approach)

## EXECUTION PLAN

1. **Initial Setup (2 hours):**

   - Create spreadsheet template with columns for all required information
   - Set up file access to all relevant source files
   - Prepare grep commands to locate `db_service` usage in each component

2. **Analysis Phase (8-12 hours):**

   - Analyze each component sequentially following the tasks above
   - Populate the spreadsheet with findings
   - Identify patterns of usage across components

3. **Consolidation Phase (4 hours):**

   - Summarize findings for each component
   - Identify common patterns across all components
   - Develop initial refactoring recommendations

4. **Documentation (2 hours):**
   - Finalize the spreadsheet
   - Create summary document with key findings
   - Outline refactoring strategy and priorities

## ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

- Use `tools/trace_deps_*.py` output files as guides to navigate the dependencies
- Refer to `src/models/*.py` to understand existing ORM models
- Consult SQLAlchemy documentation for equivalent ORM approaches to complex SQL operations

## PRIORITY ORDER

1. BatchProcessing (highest priority - affects visible UI)
2. ContentMap (affects potential UI elements)
3. DBPortal (admin functionality)
4. DevTool (admin functionality)

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

The work order is complete when:

- All `db_service` usage in each component is documented
- Each SQL operation has a proposed ORM-based alternative
- A recommended refactoring strategy is provided for each component
- Challenges and risks for the refactoring process are identified
