# Unused Code Detection: Methodology & Approach

## Overview of the Process

Our goal was to identify Python files in the codebase that are not being used by any other files, starting from the main application entry point. This document explains the approach we took, why we chose it, and how it works in detail.

## Why the Original Solution Failed

The original plan was to use the `importlab` library with `trace_imports.py`. This failed because:

1. The script attempted to import `RelativeResolver` and `AbsoluteResolver` from `importlab`.
2. These classes don't exist in the installed version of `importlab` (0.8.1).
3. The script was written for a different version of the library than what's installed.

## Our "Hybrid AST + grep" Approach

After considering options in the GPT-Feedback.md document, we implemented a "Hybrid AST + grep" approach that:

1. Uses Python's built-in `ast` module instead of `importlab`
2. Starts from the main entry point (`src/main.py`)
3. Builds a graph of imports using static analysis
4. Identifies files that are never imported in this graph

### How It Works

Our approach works as follows:

1. **Listing Files**: Find all `.py` files in the `src/` directory (excluding `__init__.py` files).
2. **Parsing Entry Point**: Use the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to parse `src/main.py` and identify:
   - Direct imports in the main file
   - Router modules included via FastAPI's `app.include_router()`
3. **Building Import Graph**: Starting from the entry point and router files:
   - Parse each file to identify its imports using AST
   - Resolve those imports to actual files in the project
   - Add those files to a queue for processing
   - Continue until no new imports are found
4. **Identifying Unused Files**: Compare the list of all Python files with those reachable in the import graph:
   - Files that appear in the graph are being used
   - Files that don't appear in the graph are candidates for being unused

### Tools Created

We created three scripts:

1. `tools/analyze_imports_ast.py` - Initial implementation (had a bug where it wrote incorrect data)
2. `tools/analyze_imports_ast_fixed.py` - Fixed version that correctly identifies unused files
3. `tools/compare_used_unused.py` - Verification script that produces the final list of unused candidates

## Why You Can Trust This Method

1. **Based on Static Analysis**: The AST module reads the actual code structure, not just text patterns.
2. **Comprehensive Starting Point**: We start from both the main app file AND all router files, which is appropriate for a FastAPI application.
3. **Conservative Approach**: The method will only mark a file as "potentially unused" if it is completely unreferenced in the import chain.
4. **Verification Step**: We double-checked our results by comparing both the used and unused files lists.
5. **Practical Results**: The final list of 24 files (out of 95) represents a reasonable percentage (~25%) of potentially unused code.

## Limitations and Considerations

This method has some limitations:

1. **Dynamic Imports**: Python code that uses `__import__()`, `importlib`, or reflection won't be detected.
2. **String-based Imports**: Code that constructs import paths as strings won't be detected.
3. **Entry Point Assumption**: We assume `src/main.py` is the primary entry point.
4. **False Positives**: Some files might be used by tests or scripts not in the main application.

## The 24 Potentially Unused Files

The analysis identified these files as potentially unused:

```
src/api/models/places.py
src/auth/auth_service.py
src/db/direct_migration.py
src/db/direct_session.py
src/db/domain_handler.py
src/models/feature_flag.py
src/models/sidebar.py
src/schemas/contact.py
src/schemas/email_scan.py
src/scraper/data_formatter.py
src/services/batch/task_debugger.py
src/services/core/auth_service.py
src/services/db_inspector.py
src/services/domain_service.py
src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py
src/services/scraping/scrape_executor_service.py
src/services/sitemap/analyzer_service.py
src/services/sitemap/background_service.py
src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py
src/services/sitemap_service.py
src/services/storage/storage_service.py
src/utils/db_schema_helper.py
src/utils/db_utils.py
src/utils/sidebar.py
```

## Next Steps

Before archiving these files, they should be:

1. Manually reviewed to confirm they aren't used dynamically
2. Checked for potential relationships to critical architecture components
3. Analyzed for dependencies between them (some may reference each other)
4. Archived according to the procedure in the work order

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components of the AST Analysis

1. **ImportVisitor class**: AST node visitor that collects import statements:
   - Regular imports (`import x`)
   - From imports (`from x import y`)
   - Relative imports (`from . import z`)

2. **Router detection**: Special logic to find FastAPI router inclusions:
   - Locates `app.include_router()` calls
   - Identifies which router modules are included

3. **Module resolution**: Maps import strings to actual files:
   - Handles package structures
   - Resolves relative imports
   - Maps module names to file paths

This approach gives us high confidence in the results while avoiding the dependency issues of the original solution.
