Based on your answers, I'll craft a comprehensive work order for Cursor AI to help clean up the audit framework and organize the valuable tools. I understand you want to:

1. Keep all markdown documentation for historical context
2. Archive irrelevant Python code/tools
3. Organize the valuable tools in a coherent directory structure
4. Create a master document for future reference

Here's a work order that addresses these needs:

# Work Order: ScraperSky Code Audit Framework Cleanup & Organization

## 1. Objective

Perform a comprehensive cleanup of the Code Audit Framework to:

1. Identify and preserve the most valuable and functional tools
2. Archive outdated or redundant code
3. Create an organized directory structure for the effective tools
4. Document the final toolset and methodology for future reference

## 2. Current State Assessment

The code audit framework has evolved through multiple iterations, resulting in a mix of:

- Working, valuable tools that successfully identify unused code
- Failed or superseded approaches that are no longer relevant
- Redundant tools performing similar functions
- Documentation spanning the entire evolution of the project

## 3. Specific Tasks

### 3.1. Tools Assessment & Organization

**Create a new directory structure:**

```
tools/
└── code_audit/               # New primary directory for audit tooling
    ├── core/                 # Core audit functionality
    ├── analyzers/            # Specialized analyzers
    ├── reports/              # Location for output reports
    └── archived/             # Archive of deprecated tools
```

**Identify and organize the most effective tools:**

1. **Move to `tools/code_audit/core/`:**

   - `run_full_trace.py` → Rename to `audit_runner.py`
   - `scheduler_trace.py`
   - `dynamic_imports.py`

2. **Move to `tools/code_audit/analyzers/`:**

   - All router-specific tracers:
     - `trace_deps_modernized_page_scraper.py`
     - `trace_deps_modernized_sitemap.py`
     - `trace_deps_batch_sitemap.py`
     - `trace_deps_google_maps_api.py`
     - `trace_deps_local_businesses.py`
     - `trace_deps_places_staging.py`
     - `trace_deps_sitemap_files.py`
     - `trace_deps_domains.py`
     - `trace_deps_db_portal.py`
     - `trace_deps_dev_tools.py`
   - `build_functional_map.py`

3. **Move to `tools/code_audit/archived/`:**
   - `trace_imports.py` (failed importlab implementation)
   - `test_importlab.py`
   - `run_single_router_trace.py` (superseded by specialized tracers)
   - Any script with `_deprecated` suffix
   - `runtime_import_logger.py` (if not actively used)

### 3.2. Code Refactoring & Improvements

1. **Consolidate and standardize the tracing tools:**

   - Update import paths in all tools to reflect new directory structure
   - Ensure consistent output paths to `reports/` directory
   - Add proper docstrings to all tools

2. **Create a unified launcher script:**

   - New file: `tools/code_audit/run_audit.py`
   - Simplified CLI interface that orchestrates the entire audit process
   - Command-line options for different types of analysis

3. **Enhance reporting capabilities:**
   - Standardize output format across all tools
   - Create consolidated report generator
   - Add options for different levels of detail

### 3.3. Documentation Consolidation

1. **Create master documentation file:**

   - File: `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.50-FINAL-Code-Audit-Framework.md`
   - Comprehensive guide describing:
     - Background and purpose of the audit framework
     - Complete inventory of available tools
     - Step-by-step usage instructions
     - Explanation of output reports
     - Common use cases and examples
     - Lessons learned from the audit process
     - Guidance on DB service technical debt analysis
     - Reference to the verification protocol

2. **Update README files:**
   - Create `tools/code_audit/README.md` with concise usage instructions
   - Add detailed comments to main script files

## 4. Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Preparation:**

   - Create the new directory structure
   - Inventory all existing tools and their dependencies

2. **Tool Migration (Iterative):**

   - For each tool identified above:
     - Copy to new location
     - Update imports and paths
     - Test functionality
     - Once verified, mark original for archiving

3. **Create Unified Interface:**

   - Develop the consolidated launcher script
   - Test with different analysis scenarios
   - Document command-line options

4. **Documentation:**

   - Draft the master documentation file
   - Create necessary README files
   - Update inline code documentation

5. **Verification:**

   - Run a complete audit using the new framework
   - Compare results with previous audit outcomes
   - Ensure all functionality is preserved

6. **Cleanup:**
   - Archive deprecated tools and redundant code
   - Remove any temporary files created during migration

## 5. Key Considerations

- **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing reports and documentation references remain valid
- **Preserve All Documentation:** Keep all markdown files intact for historical context
- **Focus on Current DB Service Analysis:** Ensure tools support ongoing DB service technical debt analysis
- **Future-Proof Design:** Create a framework that can be extended for future code audit needs

## 6. Deliverables

1. Organized and functional code audit toolset in `tools/code_audit/`
2. Comprehensive master documentation in `project-docs/41-Code-Audit-And-Archive/41.50-FINAL-Code-Audit-Framework.md`
3. Cleanup of redundant/deprecated tools (archived rather than deleted)
4. Standardized reporting mechanism for ongoing and future audits

---

This work order should provide Cursor AI with a clear roadmap for cleaning up and organizing your code audit framework. It preserves all the valuable components while archiving the outdated ones, and focuses on creating a coherent, well-documented system that you can easily use in the future.

Would you like me to expand on any particular section of this work order, or would you like more specific guidance on implementing certain aspects of it?
