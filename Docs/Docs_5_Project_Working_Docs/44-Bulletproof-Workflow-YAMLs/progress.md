# Progress Log: Bulletproof Workflow YAMLs

---

## üìù Workflow YAML Update Cheat Sheet (WIP)

Use this as a checklist for each canonical workflow YAML:

- [ ] Add required metadata fields: description, depends_on_models, depends_on_enums, architecture_reference, last_reviewed, reviewed_by
- [ ] Ensure all step actions reference real service methods/files
- [ ] Align naming conventions with project standards
- [ ] Confirm all referenced models/enums exist and are used
- [ ] Map each workflow phase to architectural principles
- [ ] Cross-check with dependency trace for completeness
- [ ] Validate against JSON schema
- [ ] Document reviewer and review date
- [ ] Update progress log with all changes

- Work order created and folder scaffolded.
- Initial objectives and deliverables defined.
- Drafted and reviewed JSON schema for workflow YAMLs.
- Validated and updated WF1-SingleSearch_CANONICAL.yaml for schema compliance, naming, and code alignment.
    - Added required metadata fields: description, depends_on_models, depends_on_enums, architecture_reference, last_reviewed, reviewed_by
    - Corrected step actions to match codebase service methods and files
    - Ensured naming conventions and structure match dependency trace and schema
    - Checked for architectural principle alignment at each workflow phase

- Cross-referenced dependency trace and architectural principles for end-to-end accuracy.
- Decided to pursue a linear, phase-by-phase blueprint guide mapping principles and requirements to each workflow phase.
- Next: Draft the blueprint template and map core principles to each workflow step for bulletproof onboarding and review.
