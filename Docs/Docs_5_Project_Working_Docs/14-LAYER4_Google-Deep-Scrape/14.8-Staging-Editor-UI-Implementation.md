## 1. Objective

To implement a user-friendly interface within `static/google-maps.html` that allows users to browse, select, and batch-update records directly from the `places_staging` table. This UI will serve as the primary means to interact with the staging data and test the crucial backend logic where setting the main status to trigger deep scanning automatically queues the selected places via the unified status update endpoint (`PUT /api/v3/places-staging/status`).

This work order clarifies and supersedes the Job ID-focused approach previously described for the Staging Editor implementation.

## 2. Scope & Requirements

Modify `static/google-maps.html` to include:

1.  **New Tab Insertion:**

    - Insert a new tab labelled "Staging Editor" immediately after the "Single Search" tab (making it the second tab).
    - Shift existing tabs ("Batch Search", "Results Viewer") one position to the right.
    - Ensure tab switching logic correctly handles the new tab order.

2.  **New Panel Creation:**

    - Create a new corresponding panel div with `id="stagingEditor"`.
    - This panel should be the active view when the "Staging Editor" tab is selected.

3.  **Panel UI Elements:**
    - **NO Job ID Input/Button:** Remove any elements related to entering or fetching by a specific Discovery Job ID.
    - **Results Table:** A table (`id="stagingTable"`) to display fetched `places_staging` records. Include columns for:
      - Checkbox for row selection.
      - Business Name.
      - Address.
      - Main Status (`status` field).
      - Deep Scan Status (`deep_scan_status` field - potentially display only).
      - Place ID (potentially hidden or display only).
    - **(Optional - Consider Later)** Filtering controls (e.g., status dropdown, name search) could be added above the table for usability.
    - **Batch Update Controls:** A distinct section (`id="stagingBatchUpdateControls"`) that appears when one or more rows are selected, containing:
      - A dropdown (`id="stagingBatchStatusUpdate"`) to select the target main status. This dropdown **must** include the option(s) that trigger deep scan queuing on the backend (e.g., label it clearly like "Select for Deep Scan"). The exact _value_ sent should match what the `PUT /api/v3/places-staging/status` endpoint expects to trigger the queuing logic.
      - An "Update Selected" button (`id="applyStagingBatchUpdate"`) which displays the current selection count (e.g., "Update 5 Selected").
      - A "Clear Selection" button (`id="clearStagingSelection"`) to clear the selected rows.
