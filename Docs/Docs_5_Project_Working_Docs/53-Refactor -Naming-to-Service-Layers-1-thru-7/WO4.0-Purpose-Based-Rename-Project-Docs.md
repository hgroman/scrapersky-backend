# Work Order: Standardize Project Working Document Names by Purpose

**Date Created:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (To be filled by AI)
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Open
**Assigned To:** AI Assistant (for document analysis and `git mv` command generation)
**Requestor:** Quarterback

## 1. Objective

To improve the organization, discoverability, and clarity of project working documents by standardizing their filenames and directory names based on their primary purpose or theme. This effort targets the `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/` directory.

## 2. Background

The `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/` directory contains a diverse collection of historical and ongoing project-related documents, notes, plans, and analyses. Many item names are legacy, numeric-prefixed, or do not clearly convey their content's core purpose. A systematic renaming based on determined purpose will make these assets more accessible and understandable, aiding in historical review and knowledge management. This is part of a broader initiative to streamline project documentation.

## 3. Scope of Work

This work order applies to all files and top-level directories currently located directly within the `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/` directory. It does not require recursive analysis and renaming of files within sub-sub-directories at this stage, though the names of items within a target directory can be used to infer its purpose.

## 4. Detailed Tasks

The assigned AI Assistant will perform the following tasks:

1.  **List Items:** Programmatically list all files and top-level directories within `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/`. Ignore common system files like `.DS_Store`.
2.  **Content/Name Analysis & Purpose Determination:**
    - **For each file:**
      - Read and analyze its content.
      - Determine its primary purpose or theme (e.g., "Initial project assessment notes," "UI bug fix documentation," "Sitemap generation research").
    - **For each top-level directory:**
      - Analyze its current name.
      - Briefly examine the names of a few items directly within it (e.g., top 3-5 files/sub-directories if applicable) to help infer a collective purpose for the directory.
      - Determine the primary purpose or theme of the directory (e.g., "Archive of initial assessment documents," "User interface improvement proposals," "Sitemap feature development working files").
    - If the purpose is ambiguous after careful consideration, flag the item for human review with a brief explanation.
3.  **New Name Generation:**
    - Based on the determined purpose, construct a new, clear, and descriptive name for each file and directory.
    - **Files:**
      - **Format:** Use `snake_case` and retain the original file extension (e.g., `meeting_notes_project_alpha.md`, `data_migration_plan_v1.docx`).
      - **Numeric Prefixes:** Analyze existing numeric prefixes. If they appear to denote a specific sequence or versioning that is still relevant, propose whether to retain them (e.g., `01_initial_project_setup_notes.md`) or to integrate their meaning into the name itself. If they seem arbitrary or obsolete, propose dropping them. Provide justification.
    - **Directories:**
      - **Format:** Use `PascalCase-Hyphenated-Name/` (e.g., `Initial-Project-Assessment-Archive/`, `Sitemap-Feature-Development/`).
      - **Numeric Prefixes:** Similar to files, analyze existing numeric prefixes. If they denote a relevant sequence or grouping, propose retention (e.g., `01-Initial-Assessment-Archive/`) or integration. If obsolete, propose dropping them. Justify the proposal.
4.  **Report Generation:**
    - Produce a Markdown formatted report listing:
      - Each original filename or directory name.
      - The determined primary purpose/theme, with a brief (1-2 sentence) justification for the choice, especially if the original name was uninformative.
      - The proposed new filename or directory name.
      - The corresponding exact `git mv` command for renaming (relative to the workspace root).
      - Example for a file: `git mv "Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/old_file.md" "Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/new_snake_case_name.md"`
      - Example for a directory: `git mv "Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/01-old-dir-name/" "Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/01-New-PascalCase-Name/"`
    - If any items are flagged for human review due to ambiguity, list them separately with a note explaining the ambiguity.

## 5. Deliverables

1.  A Markdown formatted report containing:
    - A list of all analyzed files and top-level directories from `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/`.
    - For each item:
      - The determined primary purpose/theme and justification.
      - The proposed new name (and decision regarding any numeric prefix).
      - The exact `git mv` command to execute the rename.
    - A separate list of any items flagged for human review with reasons.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- All relevant files and top-level directories in `Docs/Docs_5_Project_Working_Docs/` have been assessed.
- Each assessed item has a clearly determined purpose/theme and a corresponding new name proposal.
- New filenames follow `snake_case` (for files) and `PascalCase-Hyphenated-Name/` (for directories) conventions.
- Proposals for handling existing numeric prefixes are provided with justification.
- A `git mv` command is provided for each proposed rename.
- The justification for purpose choices is clear and concise.
- Any ambiguities are clearly documented for human review.

## 7. Assumptions

- The AI has read access to the specified directory and its contents.
- The AI can accurately interpret the primary focus of technical and project management documentation to determine its purpose.
- The AI understands the context of organizing project-related working documents.
