# Work Order: Continue AI Guide Filename Standardization

**Date Created:** 2024-05-16
**Version:** 1.1 (Supplements 1.0)
**Status:** In Progress
**Assigned To:** AI Assistant (New)
**Requestor:** Quarterback (via AI Assistant 1)
**Original Work Order:** `Docs/WO-Layer-Prefix-AI-Guides.md`
**Supporting Report:** `Docs/AI_Guide_Filename_Standardization_Report.md`

## 1. Objective

To complete the standardization of AI-generated development guide filenames in `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/` by applying layer prefixes, as per the original work order `Docs/WO-Layer-Prefix-AI-Guides.md`.

## 2. Background

An initial AI assistant (Assistant 1) performed the analysis of Markdown files in `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/`, generated a comprehensive report (`Docs/AI_Guide_Filename_Standardization_Report.md`) detailing proposed new filenames and `git mv` commands, and began executing these commands. This work order is for a new AI assistant to take over and complete the remaining renaming operations.

The user has indicated that some files may have already been handled (either by Assistant 1 or manually by the user). Therefore, it is crucial for the new AI to verify the existence of the source file and the non-existence of the target file before attempting any `git mv` operation.

## 3. Current Status of Renaming Task

- All files in `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/` were analyzed by Assistant 1.
- The full analysis, proposed new filenames, and 41 corresponding `git mv` commands are documented in `Docs/AI_Guide_Filename_Standardization_Report.md`.
- Assistant 1 successfully executed 7 of the planned `git mv` commands.
- Assistant 1 identified 5 `git mv` commands from the report that were skipped because the target filename already existed, indicating these were likely handled by the user.

## 4. Detailed Tasks for New AI Assistant

1.  **Review Contextual Documents:**

    - Thoroughly review the original work order: `Docs/WO-Layer-Prefix-AI-Guides.md`.
    - Thoroughly review the analysis and proposals report: `Docs/AI_Guide_Filename_Standardization_Report.md`. Pay close attention to the full list of 41 `git mv` commands.

2.  **Verify Current Directory State:**

    - Programmatically list all `.md` files currently present in the `Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/` directory. This is critical to ensure commands are still valid.

3.  **Identify and Execute Remaining Valid `git mv` Commands:**

    - The following 29 `git mv` commands were identified by Assistant 1 as pending. Before executing EACH command, you **MUST** verify:
      - The **source file** (e.g., `"Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.3-MCP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md"`) **currently exists**.
      - The **target file** (e.g., `"Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.3-LAYER1_MCP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md"`) **does NOT currently exist**.
    - Only if both conditions are met, proceed to execute the `git mv` command.
    - Execute commands one by one.

    **List of 29 Pending `git mv` Commands:**

    1.  `git mv "Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.3-MCP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md" "Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.3-LAYER1_MCP-TROUBLESHOOTING.md"`
