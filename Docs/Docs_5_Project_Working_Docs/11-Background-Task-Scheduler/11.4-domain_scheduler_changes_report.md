# Domain Scheduler Fix Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents the issue identified in the domain scheduler component where domains were not being processed correctly due to an improper URL formatting problem. The core issue was that the system was passing raw domain names (e.g., `domain.com`) to the metadata extractor instead of properly formatted URLs with protocol (e.g., `https://domain.com`). This report details all changes made, testing conducted, and items that still need verification.

## Issue Identification

### Problem Statement

The domain scheduler was failing to process domains correctly because:

- The `standardize_domain()` function in `src/scraper/domain_utils.py` was correctly standardizing domain names by removing http/https prefixes and www prefixes, but returning only the domain name.
- In `src/services/domain_scheduler.py`, we were passing this standardized domain directly to the metadata extraction function rather than converting it to a properly formatted URL first.
- The metadata extractor (`detect_site_metadata()` in `src/scraper/metadata_extractor.py`) expects a complete URL with protocol, not just a domain name.

### Impact

- Domains submitted for processing were remaining in a "pending" or "processing" state
- Metadata was not being extracted successfully
- Error logs showed HTTP failures when trying to fetch content

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/domain_scheduler.py**

   - Key change: Modified to properly call `get_domain_url()` to convert standardized domains to full URLs before passing to metadata extractor
   - Status: Fixed and tested

2. **src/utils/scraper_api.py**

   - Key change: Removed premium and ultra_premium parameters as per user request
   - Status: Fixed and tested

3. **scripts/test_texas_domain.py**

   - Key change: Created new test script to verify domain processing
   - Status: Fixed and tested

4. **scripts/test_texaskidney_metadata.py**
   - Key change: Created additional test script for Texas Kidney domain
   - Status: Fixed and tested

## Files Not Modified

The following files were examined but not modified:

1. **src/scraper/domain_utils.py**

   - Contains `standardize_domain()` and `get_domain_url()` functions
   - Both functions were working as expected; no changes needed

2. **src/scraper/metadata_extractor.py**
   - Contains `detect_site_metadata()` function
   - Function was working correctly when provided with proper URLs

## Detailed Changes

### src/services/domain_scheduler.py

The critical change was in the `process_pending_domains()` function within the domain scheduler. We identified that the code was using the standardized domain directly instead of converting it to a proper URL first.

Original code:

```python
# Process the domain using metadata extractor
logger.debug(f"Standardizing domain: {url}")
std_domain = standardize_domain(url)

if not std_domain:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid domain format: {url}")

logger.debug(f"Extracting metadata for domain: {std_domain}")
metadata = await detect_site_metadata(std_domain, max_retries=3)
```

Fixed code:

```python
# Process the domain using metadata extractor
logger.debug(f"Standardizing domain: {url}")
std_domain = standardize_domain(url)

if not std_domain:
    raise ValueError(f"Invalid domain format: {url}")

# Convert domain to proper URL for scraping
domain_url = get_domain_url(std_domain)
logger.debug(f"Converted domain to URL for scraping: {domain_url}")

logger.debug(f"Extracting metadata for domain: {std_domain}")
metadata = await detect_site_metadata(domain_url, max_retries=3)
```

The key change was adding the call to `get_domain_url()` to convert the standardized domain into a proper URL with the HTTPS protocol before passing it to the metadata extraction function.

### src/utils/scraper_api.py

As per user request, we removed all premium and ultra_premium parameters from the ScraperAPI client:

Original code in `_fetch_with_aiohttp` method:

```python
params = {
    'api_key': self.api_key,
    'url': url,
    'render': 'true' if render_js else 'false',
    'premium': 'true',
    'ultra_premium': 'true'
}
```

Fixed code:

```python
params = {
    'api_key': self.api_key,
    'url': url,
    'render': 'true' if render_js else 'false'
}
```

Similar changes were made to the `_fetch_with_sdk` method to remove premium parameters.

### scripts/test_texas_domain.py

Created a new test script to verify domain processing. Key features:

- Finds or creates test domain for Texas Kidney Institute
- Resets domain status to "pending" for testing
- Directly calls the domain scheduler's processing function
- Verifies the domain is processed correctly
- Checks metadata extraction results

The script includes proper session management with explicit transaction boundaries and error handling.

## Testing Conducted

1. **Texas Kidney Institute Domain Test**

   - Created a test script to specifically test the Texas Kidney Institute domain
   - Verified that the domain was processed successfully
   - Confirmed metadata extraction worked properly
   - Validated that the logo URL was correctly extracted

2. **Crystal Claims Management Domain Test**

   - Used the API endpoint to submit the domain for processing
   - Verified job status was updated to "completed"
   - Confirmed the domain was processed correctly

3. **Scheduler Transaction Handling**
   - Modified test scripts to verify proper transaction boundaries
   - Ensured sessions were properly opened and closed
   - Verified that error handling was working correctly

## Remaining Tests

The following tests should still be conducted:

1. **Multiple Domain Batch Processing**

   - Test processing multiple domains in a single batch
   - Verify all domains are processed correctly
   - Ensure any failures don't affect other domains in the batch

2. **Error Handling Tests**

   - Test with deliberately malformed domains
   - Verify error status is correctly set in the database
   - Confirm error messages are properly logged

3. **Performance Testing**

   - Test with large batches of domains
   - Measure processing time per domain
   - Verify scheduler can handle expected production load

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Test domains with special characters
   - Test domains with unusual TLDs
   - Test domains requiring redirects

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**

   - Integrate the fix into the main codebase
   - Run comprehensive tests with the full system
   - Verify all components work together correctly

2. **Monitoring Implementation**

   - Add more detailed logging for domain processing
   - Set up alerts for processing failures
   - Create dashboards for domain processing metrics

3. **Documentation Updates**

   - Update system documentation with the fix details
   - Document the correct pattern for domain URL handling
   - Create developer guidelines to prevent similar issues

4. **Code Review**
   - Conduct a thorough code review of the changes
   - Check for any similar issues in other components
   - Ensure all code follows project standards

**standardize_domain()** - Cleans and standardizes domain names:

- Removes http/https protocols
