# Backend Testing Plan: Local Business Curation to Domain Table Trigger

**Document ID:** 05-03-Backend-Testing-Plan-Local_Business-Domain-Table
**Status:** Final
**Date:** April 2025
**Author:** Gemini Assistant & User
**Related Work Order:** `03-Work-Order-Local_Business-Row-Select-to-Domain-Table.md`
**Related Implementation Details:** `04-03-Work-Order-Implementation-Details-Local_Business-Domain-Table.md`

## 1. Objective

This document outlines the systematic plan for testing the backend implementation of the workflow where selecting a `LocalBusiness` record triggers the creation of a pending `Domain` record. The goal is to ensure end-to-end functionality, verify database state changes, check logs, and validate against the requirements in the work order (`03-...md`).

## 2. Pre-requisites

- All backend code changes outlined in the implementation details document (`04-...md`) are complete.
- Database schema changes (new enum, new columns, foreign key) are applied and verified.
- A valid development JWT token (`DEV_TOKEN`) is available for API calls.
- Access to the application logs (`logs/app.log` or console output).
- Access to the database (e.g., Supabase Studio) to query `local_businesses` and `domains` tables.
- UUIDs of test `local_businesses` records (including cases with and without `website_url`, and potentially one whose domain already exists).

## 4. Detailed Testing Steps

**Step 1: Setup**

1.  **(B) Restart Server:** Execute the standard server restart command (e.g., `docker-compose restart scrapersky`) to load all code changes. Verify successful startup in logs.

**Step 2: API Trigger Verification**

1.  **(C) Test API Trigger:**
    - Identify a test `local_business` UUID (e.g., `BUSINESS_UUID_1`) that has a valid `website_url`.
    - Execute the `PUT /api/v3/local-businesses/status` endpoint using `curl`:
      ```bash
      curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/v3/local-businesses/status" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_VALID_DEV_TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
            "local_business_ids": ["BUSINESS_UUID_1"],
            "status": "Selected"
          }' | jq .
      ```
2.  **(D) Verify API Response:** Check the `curl` output. Expect HTTP status 200 OK and a JSON response similar to: `{"message": "Successfully updated status...", "updated_count": 1, "queued_count": 1}`.
3.  **(E) Verify DB Status:** Query the `local_businesses` table for `id = BUSINESS_UUID_1`. Verify `status = 'Selected'`.
4.  **(F) Verify DB Queue Status:** In the same record, verify `domain_extraction_status = 'queued'` and `domain_extraction_error = NULL`.
5.  **(G) Verify API Logs:** Check application logs for the relevant request log entry, confirming the status update and queueing were logged successfully without errors.

**(If API Trigger Fails (Z1): Debug API endpoint logic, database connection, model mapping, permissions, request format.)**

**Step 3: Background Process Verification**

1.  **(H) Wait/Trigger Scheduler:** Allow time for the `sitemap_scheduler`'s interval to elapse. Note the interval defined in `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`.
2.  **(I) Verify Scheduler Logs:** Check application logs for messages indicating the scheduler picked up the job (e.g., `Found 1 local businesses queued...`, `Processing domain extraction for local_business_id: BUSINESS_UUID_1`).
3.  **(J) Verify Worker Logs:** Check logs for messages from `LocalBusinessToDomainService` (e.g., `Starting domain extraction...`, `Extracted domain...`, `Successfully created new pending Domain...`).
4.  **(K, L) Verify DB Completion Status:** Query the `local_businesses` table for `id = BUSINESS_UUID_1`. Verify `domain_extraction_status` has updated to `'completed'` and `domain_extraction_error` remains `NULL`.
5.  **(M) Verify DB Domain Creation:** Query the `domains` table. Verify a new row exists for the domain extracted from `BUSINESS_UUID_1`'s `website_url`. Check that `status = 'pending'` and `local_business_id = BUSINESS_UUID_1`.

**(If Background Process Fails (Z2): Debug scheduler query logic, worker service logic (`create_pending_domain_from_local_business`), domain extraction utility, database interactions within the worker/scheduler, session handling.)**

**Step 4: Edge Case Verification (Optional but Recommended)**

1.  **(N, O) Test No Website URL:**
    - Identify a test `local_business` UUID (e.g., `BUSINESS_UUID_NO_URL`) with `website_url` as `NULL` or empty.
    - Repeat Step 2 (API Trigger). Verify API response shows `queued_count: 0`.
    - Wait for scheduler.
    - Verify logs show the service skipping domain creation due to no URL.
    - Verify in DB (`local_businesses` table) that `domain_extraction_status` eventually becomes `'completed'` (as the task was processed, albeit trivially). Verify no new `domains` record was created.
2.  **(N, P) Test Duplicate Domain:**
    - Identify a test `local_business` UUID (e.g., `BUSINESS_UUID_DUPE_DOMAIN`) whose `website_url` corresponds to a domain _already present_ in the `domains` table.
    - Repeat Step 2 (API Trigger).
    - Wait for scheduler.
    - Verify logs show the service detecting the existing domain and skipping creation.
    - Verify in DB (`local_businesses` table) that `domain_extraction_status` becomes `'completed'`. Verify no _new_ `domains` record was created for this specific domain.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

- Document test results (Pass/Fail for each step).
- If all primary tests pass, the backend implementation is considered verified.
