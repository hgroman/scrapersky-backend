# Data Model Layer (SQLAlchemy): Workflow Touchpoints

This document maps which SQLAlchemy model files and key classes (from `src/models/`) are primarily utilized by each of the six core workflows (WF1-WF6). It focuses on how these models are created, read, updated, or deleted (CRUD) in the context of each workflow, based on Canonical YAMLs and Dependency Traces.

## WF1-SingleSearch

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/WF1-Single Search.md`_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/place_search.py`
    - **Class:** `PlaceSearch`
      - **Role in WF1:** Created by the `google_maps_api.py` router to track the search job; its `status` field (pending, processing, complete, failed) is updated throughout the workflow by services.
  - `src/models/place.py`
    - **Class:** `Place`
      - **Role in WF1:** New `Place` records are created (or existing ones potentially updated) by `src/services/places/places_storage_service.py` to store the results from the Google Maps search. The initial `status` of these `Place` records (e.g., `PlaceStatusEnum.New`) makes them consumable by WF2.

## WF2-StagingEditor

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/v_5_REFERENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_WF2.yaml`_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/place.py`
    - **Class:** `Place`
      - **Role in WF2:** Records are read (where `status=PlaceStatusEnum.New`) for display in the Staging Editor UI. The `status` field is updated by the `places_staging.py` router based on user curation. If `status` is set to `PlaceStatusEnum.Selected`, the `deep_scan_status` field is updated to `DeepScanStatusEnum.Queued` by the router.
  - `src/models/local_business.py`
    - **Class:** `LocalBusiness`
      - **Role in WF2:** The YAML notes this model under `depends_on_models` as "Created during deep scan process, produced for WF3." This implies that the `places_deep_service.py` (part of WF2's background processing) may create `LocalBusiness` records.

## WF3-LocalBusinessCuration

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/v_8_WF3_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/local_business.py`
    - **Class:** `LocalBusiness`
      - **Role in WF3:** Records are read for display in the Local Business Curation UI. The `status` field (using `PlaceStatusEnum`) is updated by the `local_businesses.py` router. If `status` is set to `PlaceStatusEnum.Selected`, the `domain_extraction_status` field is updated to `DomainExtractionStatusEnum.Queued` by the router.
  - `src/models/domain.py`
    - **Class:** `Domain`
      - **Role in WF3:** Created or updated by `src/services/business_to_domain_service.py` after successful domain extraction from a `LocalBusiness` record.

## WF4-DomainCuration

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/v_9_WF4_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/domain.py`
    - **Class:** `Domain`
      - **Role in WF4:** Records are read for display in the Domain Curation UI. The `sitemap_curation_status` field is updated by the `domains.py` router. If `sitemap_curation_status` is set to `SitemapCurationStatusEnum.Selected`, the `sitemap_analysis_status` field is updated to `SitemapAnalysisStatusEnum.Queued` by the router.
  - `src/models/local_business.py` (as a source for domain creation, consumed by WF4)
    - **Class:** `LocalBusiness`
      - **Role in WF4:** `Domain` records are initially created/updated based on `LocalBusiness` records processed in WF3, where `domain_extraction_status` was set to `Queued`.

## WF5-SitemapCuration

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/v_10_WF5_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/sitemap.py`
    - **Class:** `SitemapFile`
      - **Role in WF5:** Records are read for display in the Sitemap Curation UI. The `deep_scrape_curation_status` field (using `SitemapDeepCurationStatusEnum`) is updated by the `sitemap_files_service.py` (called by `sitemap_files.py` router). If `deep_scrape_curation_status` is set to `SitemapDeepCurationStatusEnum.Selected`, the `sitemap_import_status` field (using `SitemapImportProcessStatusEnum`) is updated to `SitemapImportProcessStatusEnum.Queued` by the service.
  - `src/models/domain.py` (as the parent entity for sitemaps)
    - **Class:** `Domain`
      - **Role in WF5:** `SitemapFile` records are associated with a `Domain` (`domain_id`).

## WF6-SitemapImport

_References: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/WF6-SitemapImport_dependency_trace.md` and `v_10_WF5_CANONICAL.yaml` (as producer)_

- **Model File(s) & Key Classes:**
  - `src/models/sitemap.py`
    - **Class:** `SitemapFile`
      - **Role in WF6:** Read by `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py` for records where `sitemap_import_status` is `SitemapImportProcessStatusEnum.Queued`. The `sitemap_import_status` is then updated during and after the import process by `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`.
  - `src/models/page.py`
    - **Class:** `Page`
      - **Role in WF6:** New `Page` records are created by `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py` to store the URLs extracted from the processed `SitemapFile`.
