# WORK ORDER: Critical Documentation Gaps

**Date**: May 8, 2025
**Priority**: High
**Status**: Open
**Author**: Cascade (with Henry Groman)

## Executive Summary

This work order identifies critical gaps in ScraperSky's documentation ecosystem based on a comprehensive analysis of 800+ existing documents. Filling these gaps will significantly improve onboarding, implementation consistency, and reduce technical debt.

## Background

A thorough documentation dependency tree analysis was conducted on the ScraperSky backend documentation. The analysis revealed a well-structured documentation hierarchy but identified several missing components that would complete the ecosystem and improve development efficiency.

## Identified Documentation Gaps

| # | Missing Document | Priority | Rationale | Target Audience |
|---|------------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **30,000-ft Project Overview** | CRITICAL | No single document shows the complete workflow chain and relationships | New developers, PMs, AIs |
| 2 | **Service/Router Cross-Reference Guide** | HIGH | No central mapping between services, routers, and database models | Backend developers, AIs |
| 3 | **End-to-End Testing Cookbook** | HIGH | Comprehensive testing guide is missing for workflow verification | QA, Developers |
| 4 | **Schema Change Impact Analysis Template** | MEDIUM | No standard process for evaluating cascade effects of schema changes | DB Admins, Backend developers |
| 5 | **Implementation Decision Log Template** | MEDIUM | No standardized way to document key technical decisions and rationales | All engineers |
| 6 | **Workflow Handoff Points Documentation** | HIGH | Interfaces between workflows are not clearly documented | Backend developers, PMs |
| 7 | **Data Flow Diagram** | HIGH | Visual representation of data transformations through workflow stages | All team members |
| 8 | **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** | MEDIUM | Historical context for major architectural decisions is fragmented | System architects, new leads |
| 9 | **Glossary of Domain Terms** | MEDIUM | No central reference for domain-specific terminology | All stakeholders |
| 10 | **Configuration Reference** | HIGH | Comprehensive documentation of all environment variables and settings | DevOps, Developers |

## Objectives

1. **Short-term Goal (1-2 weeks)**:
   - Create the highest priority documents (30,000-ft overview, Service/Router Cross-Reference)
   - Implement templates for ongoing documentation

2. **Medium-term Goal (1 month)**:
   - Complete all HIGH priority documents
   - Begin collecting material for MEDIUM priority documents

3. **Long-term Goal (2-3 months)**:
   - Complete all identified documentation gaps
   - Establish a regular documentation review cycle

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Immediate Deliverables**
   - [x] Create documentation dependency tree - COMPLETED May 8, 2025
   - [ ] Develop 30,000-ft Project Overview - IN PROGRESS
   - [ ] Create Service/Router Cross-Reference Guide

2. **Phase 2: Template Development**
   - [ ] Schema Change Impact Analysis Template
   - [ ] Implementation Decision Log Template
   - [ ] Architectural Decision Record Template

3. **Phase 3: Technical Documentation**
   - [ ] End-to-End Testing Cookbook
   - [ ] Workflow Handoff Points Documentation
   - [ ] Data Flow Diagram
   - [ ] Configuration Reference

4. **Phase 4: Knowledge Base Components**
   - [ ] Glossary of Domain Terms
   - [ ] Architectural Decision Records for major existing components

## Success Criteria

Documentation gaps will be considered successfully addressed when:

1. All identified documents have been created and reviewed
2. Templates are in use for new development work
3. Documentation is centrally indexed and easily discoverable
4. New team members report improved onboarding experience

## Resources Required

- Access to existing documentation (already available)
- 2-4 hours per document for initial drafting
- Review time from subject matter experts (1-2 hours per document)
- Repository access for documentation updates

## Stakeholders

- Engineering team
- Product management
- New hires / onboarding personnel
- External AI assistants
