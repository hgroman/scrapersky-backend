# Supabase MCP Migration: Final Status

**Date:** 2025-05-08
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Author:** Henry Groman (with AI assistance)

## Migration Summary

The ScraperSky Backend has successfully migrated from Alembic to Supabase MCP for database schema management. All critical issues have been resolved, and the migration is complete.

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Removed all Alembic dependencies and references from the codebase
2. ✅ Configured Windsurf MCP plugin with Supabase Personal Access Token
3. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for MCP usage
4. ✅ Implemented test migrations for contact curation workflow
5. ✅ Implemented test migrations for HubSpot sync workflow (for both contacts and domains tables)
6. ✅ Fixed critical issues with migration scripts
7. ✅ Updated SQLAlchemy models to match new schema
8. ✅ Removed unnecessary local configuration files

## Final Fixes Applied

### 1. Migration Script Improvements

Migration scripts for both contact curation and HubSpot sync workflows were improved with:

- Transaction boundaries (BEGIN/COMMIT) for atomicity
- Improved error handling with RAISE NOTICE for better logging
- Defensive programming with IF NOT EXISTS checks
- Proper CREATE INDEX syntax and improved indexing
- Separated DO blocks for better error isolation
- Exception handling for each operation

### 2. SQLAlchemy Model Updates

Both Contact and Domain models were updated with:

- Added appropriate enum classes for workflow statuses
- Added new columns for both workflows:
  - workflow_status (NOT NULL with default 'New')
  - processing_status (nullable)
  - processing_error (nullable TEXT)
- Proper index and constraint configurations

### 3. Configuration Cleanup

- Removed unnecessary `.cursor/mcp.json` file
- Removed unnecessary `.windsurf/mcp.json` file
- Removed unnecessary `apply_mcp_migration.js` script
- Confirmed that Windsurf's built-in MCP plugin is sufficient

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Workflow**: Schema creation with natural language
2. **Better Versioning**: Timestamp-based migration versioning
3. **Improved Readability**: SQL migrations are self-documenting
4. **Direct Cloud Integration**: Changes apply directly to the cloud database
5. **Development Experience**: Better tooling for schema changes
6. **Minimal Configuration**: No local config files needed, just Windsurf's MCP plugin

## Next Steps

1. Migrations are already applied to the Supabase database through the Windsurf MCP plugin.

2. Verified in the Supabase database that:
   - Enum types are created: hubotsyncstatus and hubsyncprocessingstatus
   - New columns added to both contacts and domains tables
   - Indexes created correctly

3. Implement additional workflows using the same pattern

## Reference Information

- **Supabase Project ID**: ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz
- **Documentation**: See `/Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.*` for complete MCP guides
- **Backup Location**: Original migrations backed up in `/supabase/migrations/backup/`

## Conclusion

The migration from Alembic to Supabase MCP has been successfully completed. All issues have been resolved, the project now follows the standardized approach to database schema management using Supabase MCP, and we've verified that only the Windsurf MCP plugin is needed for future database changes (no local configuration files required).
