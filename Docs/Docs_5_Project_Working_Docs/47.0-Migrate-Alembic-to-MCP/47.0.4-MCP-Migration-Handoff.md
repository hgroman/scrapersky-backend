# MCP Migration Handoff Document

## Current Status
- Alembic dependencies removed from requirements.txt and setup.py
- Alembic references removed from engine.py
- Documentation created in Docs/Docs_1_AI_GUIDES/31.*
- Contact curation workflow migration created but encountering issues with implementation

## Critical Issues To Resolve
1. Migration is failing to apply correctly to the production database
2. Contact table exists but migration is failing to detect it properly
3. Need to properly test migration on production schema

## Required Actions
1. Fix and verify the migration:
   - Migration file: supabase/migrations/20250507163600_add_contact_curation_workflow.sql
   - Ensure it works with the existing contacts table structure
   - Fix the table detection issue

2. Complete git commit for all changes:
   - All migration files
   - Documentation
   - Code changes
   - CI/CD updates

3. Push to production:
   - Complete the migration
   - Verify schema changes are applied correctly
   - Document the successful completion

## Reference Information
- Supabase project ID: ddfldwzhdhhzhxywqnyz
- Migration needs to follow the contact_curation pattern using ScraperSky naming conventions
- Primary goal is to implement workflow tracking fields for contact curation
- Ensure all CI/CD pipeline updates are correctly configured

## Next Steps
1. Fix the migration script to work with the existing contacts table
2. Apply the fixed migration to production
3. Commit all changes with a clear message
4. Document successful completion

This task requires careful attention to the specific database structure and proper handling of schema migrations using Supabase MCP.
