# WORK ORDER: Bulletproof Background Services Deep Audit

## Status
Future Work Order (Queued)

## Objective
To perform a comprehensive, end-to-end audit and hardening of all background services in ScraperSky. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Job registration & lifecycle review
- Error handling & retry logic
- Transaction/session management
- Status transition/state machine diagrams
- Observability, diagnostics, and alerting
- Manual operations, recovery, and backfill
- Security, access control, and secrets management
- Test coverage and validation
- Change management and documentation automation

## Deliverables
- All findings, diagrams, and recommendations will be synthesized and appended to the canonical [BACKGROUND_SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md](cci:7://file:///Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/BACKGROUND_SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md:0:0-0:0) in `Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/`.
- Any new scripts, dashboards, or automation artifacts will be referenced and linked from this document.

## Notes
- This work order is a placeholder for a future deep-dive initiative. It is not yet scheduled, but is recognized as a critical step for operational excellence and audit-readiness.
- When this work order is activated, reference the latest version of [BACKGROUND_SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md](cci:7://file:///Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/Docs/Docs_6_Architecture_and_Status/BACKGROUND_SERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md:0:0-0:0) as the landing zone for all results.
