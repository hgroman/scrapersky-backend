# Email Scraper Refactor - Hand-Off Summary (Updated: 2025-04-14)

## Goal

Refactor the email scraping functionality (primarily `src/routers/email_scanner.py` and `src/tasks/email_scraper.py`) to use SQLAlchemy ORM instead of raw SQL, implement proper database job tracking using the `Job` model, and ensure correct database connection handling.

## Requirements Status (Based on `29.1-Work-Order-Email-Scraper-Refactor.md`)

- **Req #1 (Models):** `[X]` Complete. `Page`, `Contact` models created/verified. `Domain` model updated. User confirmed `pages` and `contacts` tables created manually in DB.
- **Req #2 (DB Connection - Task):** `[X]` Complete. `src/tasks/email_scraper.py` uses `get_background_session`.
- **Req #3 (DB Connection - Router):** `[X]` Complete. `src/routers/email_scanner.py` uses `get_session_dependency`.
- **Req #4 (User Context):** `[X]` Complete. `user_id` is passed from router to task.
- **Req #5 (Job Status Tracking):** `[~]` Partially Complete / Verification Needed.
  - **Router (`email_scanner.py`):** **Complete**. Creates `Job` record, checks DB for existing jobs.
  - **Task (`email_scraper.py`):** **Needs Verification**. Accepts `job_id`, fetches `Job` record. The core functionality of saving data (`pages`, `contacts`) **was never confirmed to be working**. Status updates (`RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, `progress`, `result_data`, `error`) were implemented according to `29.1`, but their correctness relies on the underlying scraping logic functioning, which is currently unverified.
- **Req #6 (Existing Job Check):** `[X]` Complete. Implemented in the router (`email_scanner.py`).
- **Req #7 (Failure Semantics):** `[~]` Implemented in Task, **Needs Verification** (depends on scraping logic).
- **Req #8 (Email Handling):** `[~]` Implemented in Task, **Needs Verification** (depends on scraping logic).
- **Req #9 (Imports):** `[X]` Assumed complete during refactoring.
- **Req #10 (Data Integrity):** `[ ]` Not explicitly checked.
- **Req #11 (Linting):** `[~]` Code passes Ruff, but ORM-related warnings might exist.
- **Req #12 (Testing):** `[ ]` Manual API testing done, but core task functionality unverified. No new automated tests added.
- **Req #13 (Debugging Guide):** `[N/A]` Consulted during recent debugging.
- **Req #14 (Concurrency):** `[N/A]` Not addressed.

## Recent Debugging & Changes (Outside Email Scraper Focus)

The primary focus shifted to resolving application stability issues encountered during testing:

1.  **`PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status` 500 Error:**

    - **Issue:** This endpoint consistently returned a 500 Internal Server Error.
    - **Cause:** Identified `AttributeError` due to incorrect case usage for `DeepScanStatusEnum` members (e.g., `.failed` vs `.Error`, `.queued` vs `.Queued`).
    - **Fixes Applied:**
      - Corrected `DeepScanStatusEnum.failed` to `DeepScanStatusEnum.Error` in `src/routers/places_staging.py`.
      - Corrected `DeepScanStatusEnum.queued` to `DeepScanStatusEnum.Queued` in `src/routers/places_staging.py`.
      - Corrected `DeepScanStatusEnum.queued` and other incorrect enum usages to `DeepScanStatusEnum.Queued` in `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`.
    - **Status:** Fixed. The Docker container was rebuilt to ensure the latest code was being used, and the error is no longer occurring in the logs.

2.  **Docker Build & Reload:**

    - **Issue:** Significant difficulty ensuring code changes were reflected in the running Docker container. Multiple `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up --build -d` cycles were performed.
    - **Status:** The application is currently running via `docker-compose up --build -d` with the latest code changes (including `DeepScanStatusEnum` fixes). Uvicorn's `--reload` _should_ pick up further code changes, but verification is advised after any new edits.

3.  **Static File 404 Error:**

    - **Issue:** Logs showed a `404 Not Found` error for `/static/js/local-business-curation-tab.js`.
    - **Status:** Not investigated. May indicate missing static files or incorrect routing/serving configuration. Could impact frontend functionality related to local business curation.

4.  **`DEV_TOKEN` Warning:**
    - **Issue:** Logs consistently show `WARN[0000] The "DEV_TOKEN" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.` during Docker Compose operations.
    - **Status:** Not investigated. Likely requires setting an environment variable, but impact is unknown.

## Current Blocking Problem / Status

- **Primary Unknown:** Whether the core email scraping task (`src/tasks/email_scraper.py::scan_website_for_emails`) **actually works** (i.e., processes URLs, extracts emails, saves data to `pages` and `contacts` tables). This was the original blocker and has not been verified since the ORM refactoring and recent stability fixes.
- **Secondary Unknown:** Whether the `PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status` endpoint is now functioning correctly after the `DeepScanStatusEnum` fixes.

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

1.  **Verify `PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status`:** Ask the user to retry the batch update action in the UI that previously triggered the 500 error. Check `docker-compose logs scrapersky` immediately for success or new errors.
2.  **Verify Core Email Scraping Functionality:**
    - Trigger an email scan via the API (`POST /api/v3/scan/website`). Use a known, simple website first.
    - Monitor logs: `docker-compose logs scrapersky | cat`. Look for logs specifically from `src.tasks.email_scraper`.
    - Check DB: Use `scripts/db/simple_inspect.py` (or direct DB query) to see if records are created in the `pages` and `contacts` tables for the scanned domain.
    - Check Job Status: Query the `jobs` table (or use `GET /api/v3/scan/status/{job_id}`) to verify the final status (`complete` or `failed`), `result_data`, `progress`, and `error` fields are populated correctly.
3.  **Diagnose Email Scraper (If Still Failing):** If step 2 shows no data is saved or the job fails unexpectedly, use the logs to pinpoint the failure within `scan_website_for_emails`. Debug the scraping logic (network requests, parsing, data extraction, DB inserts).
4.  **Address Static File 404 (If Necessary):** If the user reports UI issues related to local business curation, investigate the `/static/js/local-business-curation-tab.js` 404 error. Check file location, static file serving configuration in FastAPI, and Dockerfile `COPY` instructions.
5.  **Address `DEV_TOKEN` Warning (Low Priority):** Investigate where `DEV_TOKEN` is used or expected and set it appropriately (e.g., in `.env`, `docker-compose.yml`) if needed.
6.  **Complete Req #5 (Task Status):** Once the core scraping logic (step 2/3) is confirmed working, double-check that the `RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED` status updates, progress reporting, and result/error handling in `src/tasks/email_scraper.py` behave exactly as required by `29.1`.
7.  **Add Automated Tests (Req #12):** Consider adding `pytest` tests for the email scanner API endpoints and potentially the task logic.
