# Handoff: Troubleshooting Staging Editor 500 Error (Update to 'Selected' Status)

## Goal

Resolve the `500 Internal Server Error` that occurs when using the "Staging Editor" tab in the UI (`static/google-maps.html`) to update the status of one or more places to `"Selected"`.

## Problem Description

1.  User navigates to the "Staging Editor" tab.
2.  User selects one or more rows (places) using the checkboxes.
3.  User selects `"Selected"` from the "Set Status To:" dropdown (`#stagingBatchStatusUpdate`).
4.  User clicks the "Update N Selected" button (`#applyStagingBatchUpdate`).
5.  The UI displays an error message: `Error updating status: HTTP error! Status: 500 - Internal Server Error`.

This indicates a failure in the backend endpoint responsible for handling this batch status update.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1.  **Identified UI Flow:** Traced the user action from the button click in `static/js/staging-editor-tab.js` (`batchUpdateStagingStatus` function). This function correctly identifies the selected `place_ids` and the target status (`"Selected"`).
2.  **Identified Backend Endpoint:** The JavaScript sends a `PUT` request to `/api/v3/places/staging/status`.
3.  **Identified Backend Logic:** The request is handled by the `update_places_status_batch` function in `src/routers/places_staging.py`.
4.  **Located Potential Issue:** The core issue was suspected to be in the mapping between the API status enum (`PlaceStagingStatusEnum` from `src/models/api_models.py`) and the Database status enum (`PlaceStatusEnum` from `src/models/place.py`). Specifically, line 224 compared enum member names directly:
    ```python
    # Original code
    target_db_status_member = next((member for member in PlaceStatusEnum if member.name == new_main_status.name), None)
    ```
    This direct name comparison (`"Selected" == "Selected"`) was flagged as potentially fragile and sensitive to hidden case discrepancies.
5.  **Applied Fix:** The comparison on line 224 of `src/routers/places_staging.py` was changed to be case-insensitive:
    ```python
    # Modified code
    target_db_status_member = next((member for member in PlaceStatusEnum if member.name.lower() == new_main_status.name.lower()), None)
    ```
6.  **Restarted Container:** The Docker container was restarted (`docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`) to ensure the change was active (leveraging the volume mount).
7.  **Confirmed Error Persists:** The user confirmed via screenshot that the 500 error still occurs even after applying the fix and restarting the container.

## Current Status & Hypothesis

The case-insensitive comparison fix, which was expected to resolve the issue, did not work. The 500 error persists specifically when updating to the "Selected" status.

Possible remaining causes:

- **Volume Mount/Code Sync Issue:** Despite restarting, the container might _still_ not be running the absolute latest version of `src/routers/places_staging.py` with the `.lower()` fix. Volume mounts can sometimes have caching or syncing quirks.
- **Error _After_ Status Mapping:** The error might be occurring _after_ the status mapping on line 224 succeeds. Perhaps the logic related to `trigger_deep_scan` (which activates specifically for the `Selected` status, lines 232-235 and 277-281) has an issue.
- **Database Constraint/Trigger:** An underlying database issue (constraint, trigger, data type mismatch related to the `status` or `deep_scan_status` columns) might be triggered only when setting the status to `Selected`.
- **Subtle Enum Definition Mismatch:** There might still be a less obvious mismatch or problem within the definitions of `PlaceStagingStatusEnum` or `PlaceStatusEnum` themselves.

## Next Steps for Debugging

1.  **Verify Active Code:**
    - Exec into the running container: `docker-compose exec scrapersky bash`
    - Check the content of the specific line: `cat /app/src/routers/places_staging.py | grep -n "member.name.lower() == new_main_status.name.lower()"`
    - Ensure this line is _exactly_ present in the running container's file. If not, investigate the volume mount and file syncing.
2.  **Test Endpoint Directly with `curl`:**
    - Obtain a valid `place_id` from the user from the Staging Editor grid.
    - Run the following `curl` command (replace `<PLACE_ID>` and verify the token):
      ```bash
      curl -X PUT \
           -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" \
           -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           -d '{"place_ids": ["<PLACE_ID>"], "status": "Selected"}' \
           http://localhost:8000/api/v3/places/staging/status -v
      ```
    - Analyze the verbose output (`-v`) and the response body for specific error details returned by FastAPI/Starlette or SQLAlchemy.
3.  **Add Detailed Logging:**

    - In `src/routers/places_staging.py`, add logging _before and after_ line 224:

      ```python
      logger.debug(f"Attempting to map API status: Name={new_main_status.name}, Value={new_main_status.value}")
      logger.debug(f"Database enum members: {[m.name for m in PlaceStatusEnum]}")
      # ... line 224 ...
      target_db_status_member = next((member for member in PlaceStatusEnum if member.name.lower() == new_main_status.name.lower()), None)
      logger.debug(f"Mapped DB status member: {target_db_status_member.name if target_db_status_member else 'None'}")

      if target_db_status_member is None:
          # ... existing error handling ...

      logger.debug(f"Proceeding with DB status: {target_db_status_member.name}")
      # ... rest of the function ...
      ```

    - Restart the container and reproduce the error. Check the `docker-compose logs scrapersky` for these detailed messages. This will confirm if the mapping itself is failing or if the error occurs later.

4.  **Examine `trigger_deep_scan` Logic:** If the logs show the status mapping succeeds, scrutinize the code block that queues for deep scan (lines 232-235 and 277-281) for potential errors (e.g., issues with `DeepScanStatusEnum.Queued`, database updates in that block).
5.  **Review Enum Definitions:** Carefully re-examine `src/models/api_models.py::PlaceStagingStatusEnum` and `src/models/place.py::PlaceStatusEnum` for any subtle differences or inconsistencies.

## Relevant Files

- `src/routers/places_staging.py` (Backend endpoint logic)
- `src/models/api_models.py` (Contains `PlaceStagingStatusEnum`)
- `src/models/place.py` (Contains `PlaceStatusEnum`, `DeepScanStatusEnum`, `Place` model)
- `static/google-maps.html` (UI structure)
- `static/js/staging-editor-tab.js` (Frontend JavaScript for the tab)
- `docker-compose.yml` (Defines services and volume mounts)

## Resolution

1.  **Verified Active Code:** Confirmed via `docker exec` and `grep` that the `.lower()` fix on line 224 of `src/routers/places_staging.py` was active in the running container, ruling out code sync issues.
2.  **Tested Endpoint with `curl`:** The `curl` command confirmed the `500 Internal Server Error` persisted.
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"place_ids": ["ChIJe3RiKfYvzokReOE1SUTIvF4"], "status": "Selected"}' \
         http://localhost:8000/api/v3/places/staging/status -v | cat
    # Output: {"error":true,"message":"Database error during batch status update.","status_code":500}
    ```
3.  **Added Detailed Logging:** Logging statements were added around the status mapping (line 224) and within the transaction block in `src/routers/places_staging.py`.
4.  **Analyzed Logs:** After restarting the container and re-running the `curl` command, `docker-compose logs scrapersky` revealed the specific error:
    ```
    ERROR - Database error during batch status update (ORM fetch-update): Error
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/app/src/routers/places_staging.py", line 268, in update_places_status_batch
        if target_db_status_member == PlaceStatusEnum.Error:  # type: ignore
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.11/enum.py", line 786, in __getattr__
        raise AttributeError(name) from None
    AttributeError: Error
    ```
5.  **Identified Root Cause:** The traceback clearly showed an `AttributeError: Error` on line 268. The code was checking if the _database_ status enum (`PlaceStatusEnum`) matched `Error`. However, inspecting `src/models/place.py` confirmed `PlaceStatusEnum` has no `Error` member.
6.  **Applied Final Fix:** The condition on line 268 was corrected. Instead of checking the _mapped database status_ (`target_db_status_member`) against the non-existent `PlaceStatusEnum.Error`, it was changed to check the _incoming API status_ (`new_main_status`) against the correct member in the _API status enum_, which is `PlaceStagingStatusEnum.DEEP_SCAN_ERROR` (defined in `src/models/api_models.py`).

    ```python
    # Original code (line 268)
    # if target_db_status_member == PlaceStatusEnum.Error: # Incorrect: PlaceStatusEnum has no 'Error'

    # Corrected code (line 268)
    if new_main_status == PlaceStagingStatusEnum.DEEP_SCAN_ERROR:
        # ... rest of the block ...
    ```

7.  **Confirmed Resolution:** After restarting the container with the corrected code, the `curl` command returned a `200 OK` status, confirming the issue was resolved.
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer scraper_sky_2024" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"place_ids": ["ChIJe3RiKfYvzokReOE1SUTIvF4"], "status": "Selected"}' \
         http://localhost:8000/api/v3/places/staging/status -v | cat
    # Output: {"message":"Status update request processed. Matched and updated: 1 places. Queued for deep scan: 1.","updated_count":1,"queued_count":1}
    ```
