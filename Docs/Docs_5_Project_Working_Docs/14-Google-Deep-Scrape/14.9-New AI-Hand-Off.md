# Handoff Document: Verify Core Deep Scrape Backend Workflow

**Document ID:** 14.9-New AI-Hand-Off.md
**Date:** 2023-04-03
**From:** AI Assistant (Gemini Instance 1)
**To:** Next AI Assistant

## 1. OVERALL GOAL & CURRENT PRIORITY

**Goal:** Implement and test the Curation-Driven Deep Scrape feature (Plan: `14.1`). This allows users to select businesses from `places_staging`, triggering a detailed data fetch into `local_businesses` via a background process.

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY:** Verify the core backend workflow end-to-end. The UI implementation (`14.8`) is secondary and **contingent** on confirming the backend functions as designed. Do NOT proceed with UI work until the backend verification is complete.

## 2. KEY BACKEND VERIFICATION POINTS (CRITICAL NEXT STEPS)

The following components and interactions form the core loop and MUST be verified:

1.  \*\*"Smart" Status Update Endpoint (`PUT /api/v3/places-staging/status`):

    - Location:\*\* `src/routers/places_staging.py`
    - **Verification Needed:** Does calling this endpoint with the specific status value intended to trigger a deep scan (e.g., 'Selected', 'SELECTED_FOR_DEEP_SCAN' - verify exact value expected by the code) reliably update **BOTH** the main `status` field AND set `deep_scan_status = 'queued'` in the `places_staging` table within a single transaction?
    - **Action:**
      - Review the endpoint code in `src/routers/places_staging.py`.
      - Perform targeted testing using `curl`. Send a request with test `place_ids` and the trigger status.
      - Immediately query the `places_staging` table to confirm both `status` and `deep_scan_status` were updated correctly for the test IDs.

2.  \*\*Background Scheduler Monitoring (`deep_scan_status = 'queued'`):

    - Location:\*\* **Confirmed:** `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` within the `process_pending_jobs` function.
    - **Verification Needed:** Does the `process_pending_jobs` function in the scheduler reliably query the `places_staging` table for records where `deep_scan_status = 'queued'`?
    - **Action:**
      - Review the querying logic within `process_pending_jobs` in `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`.
      - Test by manually setting `deep_scan_status = 'queued'` for a test record and observing scheduler logs or subsequent actions.

3.  \*\*Deep Scan Service Triggering:

    - Location:\*\* Scheduler job logic (within `process_pending_jobs` in `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`).
    - **Verification Needed:** Upon finding a 'queued' item, does the scheduler correctly update its `deep_scan_status` to `'processing'` and successfully trigger the deep scan processing logic (specifically, `PlacesDeepService.process_single_deep_scan`), passing the correct `place_id` and `tenant_id`?
    - **Action:**
      - Review the scheduler job code in `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` that handles triggering `process_single_deep_scan`.
      - Add logging or use a debugger to trace the call to the deep scan service.
      - Verify the `deep_scan_status` update to `'processing'` in the database _before_ the service call.

4.  \*\*Deep Scan Service Execution & Persistence:

    - Location:\*\* `src/services/places/places_deep_service.py` (method like `process_single_deep_scan`?)
    - **Verification Needed:** Does this service logic correctly:
      - Receive the `place_id`?
      - Call the Google Places Details API?
      - Handle API success/errors?
      - Map the data to the `LocalBusiness` model?
      - Successfully save/upsert the data into the `local_businesses` table?
    - **Action:**
      - Review the deep scan service code.
      - Unit test the service logic extensively, mocking external API calls and database interactions.
      - Integration test by allowing the scheduler to trigger it for a real `place_id` (potentially with API call mocked initially, then live).
      - Verify data appears correctly in the `local_businesses` table.

5.  \*\*Final Status Update (`completed`/`failed`):

    - Location:\*\* `src/services/places/places_deep_service.py`
    - **Verification Needed:** Upon completion (success or failure) of the deep scan for a place, does the service reliably update the `deep_scan_status` in the corresponding `places_staging` record to `'completed'` or `'failed'` (and populate `deep_scan_error` if applicable)?
    - **Action:**
      - Review the status update logic at the end of the deep scan service method.
      - Verify this update as part of the integration testing in step 4.

6.  \*\*General Staging Data Browsing Endpoint (For UI - Lower Priority):
    - Location:\*\* `src/routers/places_staging.py` (Likely)
    - **Verification Needed:** Does an endpoint exist (e.g., `GET /api/v3/places/staging/`) that allows fetching paginated data from `places_staging` _without_ a `discovery_job_id`? What are its path and parameters (`page`, `size`, filtering)?
    - **Action:**
      - Review router code and OpenAPI schema (`/openapi.json`).
      - Test potential endpoints with `curl`.
      - (This verification can happen _after_ the core backend loop in steps 1-5 is confirmed).

## 3. SUMMARY OF RECENT PROGRESS (Supporting Context)

- **Core Logic Implemented (Partial):** Initial versions of the smart status endpoint, direct queueing endpoint, and deep scan service logic were implemented/discussed (ref `14.2` log).
- **Models Updated:** `Place` model (`places_staging`) updated with `deep_scan_status` etc.; `LocalBusiness` model (`local_businesses`) defined (ref `14.1`, `14.2`). DB changes applied via SQL.
- **Key Bugs Fixed:** Resolved API routing prefix errors (`main.py`) and critical DB enum mismatch preventing place storage (`models/place.py`, `services/places/places_storage_service.py`). Storage confirmed working with test script.
- **UI Planned:** User-centric UI requirements defined in Work Order `14.8`, superseding earlier plans.

## 4. ROADBLOCK (Less Critical Now)

- **UI File Edits:** Previous attempts to edit `static/google-maps.html` via AI tools failed. Manual application of UI changes will likely be needed _after_ backend verification is complete.

## 5. KEY FILES (Focus on Backend)

- **Routers:** `src/routers/places_staging.py`
- **Services:** `src/services/places_deep_service.py`, `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` (**Confirmed:** Handles both sitemap and deep scan background processing)
- **Models:** `src/models/place.py`, `src/models/local_business.py`
- **DB Tables:** `places_staging`, `local_businesses`
- **Planning:** `14.1` (Overall Plan), `14.2` (Progress), `14.8` (UI Plan)

## 6. RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1.  Start with verification point #1: Review and test the `PUT /api/v3/places-staging/status` endpoint's dual-update logic.
2.  Proceed sequentially through the backend verification points (#2 - #5).
3.  Verify the browsing endpoint (#6) once the core loop is confirmed.
4.  Only tackle the UI implementation (`14.8`) _after_ the backend verification is successful.
