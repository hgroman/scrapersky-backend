**Date:** 2024-07-16
**Assignee:** AI Assistant / Developer
**Parent Work Order:** `project-docs/28-CLEAN-UP-Pre-Render/28.3-Post-MVP-Page-Rename-Tasks.md` (Task 3)
**Related Files:** `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html`

## 1. Objective

To review the internal text content (headers, labels, buttons, etc.) within the `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` file to ensure it aligns logically and consistently with the page's overall purpose as the "ScraperSky MVP" development and testing interface, following its renaming from `google-maps.html`.

## 2. Workflow Steps

1.  **Read File Content:**

    - **Action:** Read the full content of `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html`.
    - **Output:** File content available for review.

2.  **Review Text Elements:**

    - **Action:** Systematically review the text content within the HTML structure.
    - **Focus:** Examine elements like:
      - `<title>` tag.
      - Main page header (`<h1>`).
      - Tab names (`<div class="tab">`).
      - Panel headers (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>` within each panel ID like `singleSearch`, `stagingEditor`, etc.).
      - Form labels (`<label>`).
      - Button text (`<button>`).
      - Descriptive text or placeholders.
    - **Assessment:** Check if any text is overly specific to the old "Google Maps" context or could be slightly adjusted for better clarity within the broader "ScraperSky MVP" theme.

3.  **Document Findings & Decision:**

    - **Action:** Based on the review, decide if any text adjustments are necessary.
    - **Output:**
      - **If changes needed:** A list of specific, minor text changes proposed (e.g., "Change H2 in 'singleSearch' panel from 'Search for Places' to 'Single Place Search'").
      - **If no changes needed:** A confirmation statement that the current internal text content is sufficiently clear and consistent with the MVP interface purpose.

4.  **Propose and Apply Edits (If Necessary):**
    - **Action:** If minor text changes were identified in Step 3, propose and apply these edits to `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html`.
    - **Output:** Modified `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` or confirmation that no edits were applied.

## 3. Completion Criteria

- The internal text content of `static/scraper-sky-mvp.html` has been reviewed.
