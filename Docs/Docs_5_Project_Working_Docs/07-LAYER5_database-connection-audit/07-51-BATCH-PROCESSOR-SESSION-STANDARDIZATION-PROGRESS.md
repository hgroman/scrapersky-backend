# BATCH PROCESSOR SESSION STANDARDIZATION PROGRESS REPORT

## Investigation Summary

After conducting a systematic search of the `batch_processor_service.py` file according to the work order, I've completed a thorough analysis of database session handling patterns.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Background Task Function - `process_batch_with_own_session`

This function is already following the correct pattern:

```python
async def process_batch_with_own_session(batch_id: str, domains: List[str], tenant_id: str, user_id: str, max_pages: int = 1000) -> None:
    # ...
    try:
        # Import properly from the session module
        from ...session.async_session import get_session
        # ...
        try:
            # Create a new session specifically for this background task
            async with get_session() as session:
                # ...properly creates transactions with session.begin()
```

Key points:

- Correctly imports `get_session` from the session module
- Uses the context manager pattern with `async with get_session() as session`
- Properly manages transaction boundaries with `async with session.begin()`
- Handles errors appropriately with try/except blocks

### 2. Database Operation Functions

All service methods (`create_batch`, `process_domains_batch`, `get_batch_status`) correctly:

- Accept a session parameter passed from the router
- Don't manage transaction boundaries themselves
- Follow the transaction-aware pattern

### 3. Router Implementation

The router correctly:

- Owns transaction boundaries using `async with session.begin()`
- Passes the session to service methods
- Handles errors appropriately

### 4. Issue with Batch Status Endpoint

The problem appears to be isolated to the pgbouncer error in the screenshot, not in the code itself. The database connection is configured correctly, but there may be an issue with the pgbouncer setup:

```
(sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.asyncpg.Error) : prepared statement "_asyncpg_8f9379c7-3feb-437e-bfc4-12dd8d4e52b0_" does not exist HINT: NOTE: pgbouncer with pool_mode set to "transaction" or "statement" does not support prepared statements properly.
```

This suggests that the connection pooler (pgbouncer) is configured with a mode that doesn't support prepared statements, but our code is trying to use them.

## Recommendation

The code patterns in `batch_processor_service.py` are already following the correct standards. The issue appears to be related to the Supavisor connection through pgbouncer rather than the service code itself.

The issue is likely in the router's handling of db_params, which needs to be fixed in the endpoint or in how execution options are passed to the session.

### Specific Fix Needed

In `batch_page_scraper.py`, the `get_batch_status_endpoint` function needs to ensure Supavisor compatibility by passing the appropriate execution options to the session:

```python
# Router owns transaction boundary - MODIFY THIS SECTION
async with session.begin():
    # Get batch status with session parameter
    batch_status = await get_batch_status(
        session=session,  # Pass session to service
        batch_id=validated_batch_id,
        tenant_id=tenant_id
    )
```

Since the router already includes the `db_params` dependency but doesn't use it for session execution, we should modify this to use the parameters correctly with the session.

## Next Steps

1. Implement router-level fix to properly handle Supavisor compatibility
2. Verify fix by testing the batch status endpoint
3. Document the full implementation in a completion report
