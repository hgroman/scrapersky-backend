# Background Task Transaction and ORM Audit & Fix Summary (Work Order 19.1)

**Date:** April 8, 2024

## 1. Objective

To audit background task modules (identified via `get_background_session` usage) for compliance with established transaction management patterns (specifically, Guide `13-TRANSACTION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` Background Task Pattern) and the absolute ORM requirement (Guide `01-ABSOLUTE_ORM_REQUIREMENT.md`), and apply necessary fixes.

## 2. Audit Findings and Actions Taken

The following files using `get_background_session` were reviewed:

### 2.1. `src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py`

- **Status:** FIXED (Prior to this specific audit task, as part of initial debugging for Work Order 18).
- **Initial Issue:** Nested transactions (`session.begin()` inside `get_background_session`) and commits within the called adapter service (`DomainToSitemapAdapterService`) caused `InvalidRequestError`.
- **Fix Applied:** Refactored to use a single `async with get_background_session() as session:` block. Removed commits from the adapter service. The main context manager now handles batch commit/rollback.

### 2.2. `src/services/domain_scheduler.py`

- **Status:** FIXED.
- **Issues Found:**
  - **Transaction Pattern Violation:** Used multiple, separate `async with get_background_session()` blocks for different steps (fetch, update status, update results, error handling) within a single run, breaking batch atomicity.
  - **Redundant Transactions:** Used `async with session.begin():` inside the `get_background_session` blocks.
  - **ORM Violation:** Heavily used raw SQL (`text(...)`) instead of ORM methods.
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Refactored `process_pending_domains` to use a single `async with get_background_session() as session:` for the entire batch.
  - Replaced raw SQL with ORM methods (`select`, object attribute updates).
  - Removed redundant `session.begin()` calls.
  - Integrated error handling to update status in memory within the main session context.
  - Removed the separate `handle_domain_error` function.

### 2.3. `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py` (`process_pending_jobs`)

- **Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED (Minimal Fix Applied).
- **Issues Found:**
  - **Mixed Concerns:** Function handles 3 distinct task types (Sitemaps, Deep Scans, Domain Extractions).
  - **Transaction Pattern Violation (Error Handling):** For Deep Scans and Domain Extractions, the `except` blocks incorrectly created _new_ sessions (`failure_session`) to mark items as failed, breaking batch atomicity.
  - **Redundant Transactions:** Used `async with session.begin():` in the initial sitemap job fetch.
  - **ORM Usage:** Mixes ORM and raw SQL.
- **Fix Applied (Minimal):**
  - Removed redundant `session.begin()` in sitemap fetch.
  - Removed the creation of new sessions in the `except` blocks for deep scans and domain extractions. Error handling now updates the object status _in memory_ using the existing batch session.
- **Further Recommended Action (Deferred):** Split `process_pending_jobs` into three separate internal helper functions (one per task type), each with its own correct transaction handling block (`async with get_background_session()`). Convert remaining raw SQL to ORM.

### 2.4. `src/services/page_scraper/domain_processor.py`

- **Status:** FIXED (ORM Requirement).
- **Issues Found:**
  - **ORM Violation:** Used raw SQL (`text(...)`) exclusively for database operations.
  - **Transaction Pattern:** Uses the "Isolated Session Pattern" (separate `get_background_session` block for each step/helper function). This differs from the unified batch pattern but appears intentional for this module.
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Refactored all helper functions (`get_or_create_domain_orm`, `update_job_status_orm`) to use SQLAlchemy ORM, replacing raw SQL.
  - Maintained the existing isolated session pattern per operation.

## 3. Remaining Audit Tasks

The following files identified via `grep` still require auditing for transaction pattern and ORM compliance:

- `src/services/batch/batch_functions.py`
- `src/services/sitemap/background_service.py`
- `src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py` (Note: Parts of this, like `process_domain_with_own_session`, were indirectly reviewed but the whole file needs checking).

## 4. Next Steps

1.  Perform testing on the modified files (`domain_scheduler.py`, `sitemap_scheduler.py`, `domain_processor.py`) to verify functionality and ensure no regressions were introduced.
2.  Continue the audit on the remaining files listed above.
3.  (Optional/Future) Implement the full refactoring recommendation for `sitemap_scheduler.py` (splitting the function).
