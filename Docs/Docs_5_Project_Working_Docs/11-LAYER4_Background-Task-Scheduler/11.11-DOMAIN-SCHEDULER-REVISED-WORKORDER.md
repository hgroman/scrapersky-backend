# Domain Scheduler Revised Work Order

## Executive Summary

This revised work order corrects the previous assumptions in 11.10-DOMAIN-SCHEDULER-REVAMP-WORKORDER and focuses only on the tasks that are actually necessary. The highest priority task from the previous work order was based on an incorrect assumption about code duplication that does not exist.

The primary issue identified and resolved was the use of raw SQL queries instead of the existing ORM methods in the Domain model. This has already been addressed by modifying the domain_scheduler.py file to use the Domain.update_from_metadata() method.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Configurable Scheduler Parameters (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - COMPLETED

**Issue:** Scheduler parameters like interval and batch size should be configurable via settings.

**Implemented Changes:**

- Added scheduler configuration settings to /src/config/settings.py:
  - DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES: int = 1
  - DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_BATCH_SIZE: int = 10
  - DOMAIN_SCHEDULER_MAX_INSTANCES: int = 1
- Modified domain_scheduler.py to use these settings
- Added documentation in .env.example and docker-compose.yml
- Added detailed usage guidelines to README.md

**Locations:**

- /src/config/settings.py
- /src/services/domain_scheduler.py
- /.env.example
- /docker-compose.yml
- /README.md

**Completion Date:** April 1, 2025

### 2. Enhanced Metrics (LOW PRIORITY)

**Issue:** The scheduler lacks structured metrics for performance monitoring.

**Required Changes:**

- Add a SchedulerMetrics class for collecting performance data
- Modify the scheduler to track and record metrics
- Implement metrics storage using ORM methods, not raw SQL

**Locations:**

- /src/services/domain_scheduler.py

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Metrics are collected for each scheduler run
- Performance data includes domain counts, success rates, and timing
- Metrics are stored in an accessible format (logs or database)
- Implementation uses ORM methods, not raw SQL

**Estimated Effort:** 1 day

## Testing Requirements

Test the scheduler with:

1. Different configuration settings
2. Various domain processing scenarios
3. Error conditions to verify metrics collection

## Implementation Notes

- All changes must utilize existing ORM methods
- No raw SQL queries should be added
- Changes should be minimal and focused

## References

- Previous fix that replaced raw SQL with ORM methods
- Domain model in /src/models/domain.py
- Existing scheduler in /src/services/domain_scheduler.py
