# AI Persona Certification Authority - RFQ Package

## Package Contents

This package contains the complete Request for Proposal and supporting documentation for the AI Persona Certification Authority system.

### Main Document
- **AI_Persona_Certification_Authority_RFQ.md** - Complete RFP with problem statement, requirements, and evaluation criteria

### Examples Directory
- **anti_stub_covenant_excerpt.md** - The specific text that AIs consistently fabricate
- **verification_qa_examples.md** - Real AI responses showing fabrication patterns
- **work_order_sample.md** - Category-based certification workflow example
- **test_sentinel_boot_sequence_excerpt.md** - Key sections from v1.8 boot sequence

### Context Directory
- **boot_sequence_evolution_summary.md** - v1.6 to v1.8 progression and persistent problems

## Key Problem Demonstrated

Despite 8 iterations of boot sequence improvements, AI personas consistently:
- ✅ Execute functional tool calls correctly
- ✅ Demonstrate architectural understanding
- ❌ Fabricate specific details when tested
- ❌ Present fabrications with false confidence

## Proposed Solution

External MCP-based Certification Authority that:
- Blocks persona activation until verified knowledge
- Uses category-specific testing based on work orders
- Employs semantic watermarking to detect fabrication
- Provides adaptive questioning until 100% accuracy

## For Reviewers

Please analyze the complete problem space and propose solutions that address the fundamental AI fabrication challenge in mission-critical coding environments.
