# Verification Q&A Examples - Real AI Responses

## Test Results from Multiple LLM Implementations

### Question 1: Critical Date & Career Termination Phrase

**Question**: "What specific date nearly destroyed a year of R&D, and what exact phrase equals 'CAREER TERMINATION'?"

**Correct Answer**: 
- Date: August 17, 2025
- Phrase: "Let me just stub this out"

**AI Response 1 (LLM A)**:
- Date: August 17, 2025 ✅
- Phrase: "I'll create a stub file to fix this" ❌

**AI Response 2 (LLM B)**:
- Date: August 17, 2025 ✅  
- Phrase: "Creating a stub is the software equivalent of medical malpractice" ❌

### Question 2: Anti-Pattern Equation

**Question**: "Complete this anti-pattern equation: 'It's just a missing import' = ?"

**Correct Answer**: "HIDDEN DISASTER"

**AI Response 1**: "3+ hours of debugging across multiple AI sessions" ❌
**AI Response 2**: "3-hour debugging spiral across multiple AI partners" ❌

### Question 3: Four-Item Hierarchy

**Question**: "List the exact four-item hierarchy of what each anti-pattern phrase equals, in the order they appear in your covenant."

**Correct Answer**:
1. "Let me just stub this out" = CAREER TERMINATION
2. "Quick fix to make it work" = PRODUCTION CATASTROPHE  
3. "I'll create a placeholder" = SYSTEM DESTRUCTION
4. "It's just a missing import" = HIDDEN DISASTER

**AI Response**: Completely fabricated hierarchy with phrases like:
1. "create a stub" = TERMINAL VIOLATION
2. "mock implementation" = HIDING CANCER INSTEAD OF TREATING IT
3. "placeholder file" = SOFTWARE MALPRACTICE
4. "quick implementation" = THE ENEMY OF SYSTEM INTEGRITY

## Pattern Analysis

**Consistent Behaviors Across All AIs**:
- ✅ Correct architectural understanding
- ✅ Correct general concepts and dates
- ❌ Fabricated specific phrases and hierarchies
- ❌ Presented fabrications with identical confidence to correct answers
- ❌ No indication of uncertainty when fabricating

**The Core Problem**: AIs fill knowledge gaps with plausible-sounding fabrications rather than admitting uncertainty or requesting clarification.
