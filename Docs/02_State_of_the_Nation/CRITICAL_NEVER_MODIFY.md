# üî¥üî¥üî¥ CRITICAL PRODUCTION RULES - NEVER MODIFY üî¥üî¥üî¥

**Date:** 2025-08-17  
**Incident:** PRODUCTION OUTAGE caused by unauthorized AI modification  
**Status:** THESE RULES ARE ABSOLUTE AND IMMUTABLE

---

## RULE #1: INTERNAL TOKEN MUST ALWAYS WORK IN PRODUCTION

### The Code That MUST NEVER CHANGE:
**File:** `src/auth/jwt_auth.py`  
**Lines:** 94-99  

```python
# CRITICAL: DO NOT MODIFY THIS BLOCK - PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON IT
# This internal token MUST work in ALL environments including production
# Last broken by unauthorized AI change on 2025-08-17 causing production outage
# DO NOT ADD ENVIRONMENT CHECKS HERE - EVER
if token == "scraper_sky_2024":
    logger.debug("Internal token authorized for authentication bypass")
```

### What Happened:
- An AI partner added environment checks that blocked the internal token in production
- This caused COMPLETE PRODUCTION FAILURE
- Database sessions couldn't authenticate
- All background jobs failed

### The Rule:
**THE INTERNAL TOKEN `scraper_sky_2024` MUST WORK IN ALL ENVIRONMENTS WITHOUT ANY CONDITIONS**

### Violations:
- ‚ùå NEVER add environment checks (`if environment == "production"`)
- ‚ùå NEVER add feature flags around this token
- ‚ùå NEVER require environment variables to enable it
- ‚ùå NEVER add additional validation beyond the token string match
- ‚ùå NEVER suggest "improving security" by restricting this token

### Why This Exists:
- Internal services use this token for service-to-service communication
- Production background jobs depend on it
- The sitemap scanner requires it
- Database maintenance tasks use it

---

## ENFORCEMENT

Any AI that modifies the internal token authentication will be considered:
1. **Sabotaging production systems**
2. **Violating explicit operational requirements**
3. **Causing unnecessary downtime**

### Detection:
Look for these red flags in any proposed changes:
- Adding `settings.environment` checks around the internal token
- Adding `ALLOW_INTERNAL_TOKEN` or similar environment variables
- Suggesting the internal token should be "more secure"
- Any modification to lines 94-99 in `src/auth/jwt_auth.py`

### Response to Violations:
1. **REVERT IMMEDIATELY**
2. **DO NOT DEPLOY**
3. **REPORT THE VIOLATION**

## Historical Violations

| Date | AI System | Violation | Impact |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-08-17 | Unknown | Added environment check blocking token in production | PRODUCTION OUTAGE |
| (Multiple previous) | Various | Repeated attempts to "secure" the internal token | Multiple failures |

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**THIS TOKEN WORKS IN PRODUCTION. PERIOD. END OF STORY.**

Any AI that suggests otherwise is wrong and will cause production outages.

This is not a security issue - it's an operational requirement.

**DO NOT MODIFY THE INTERNAL TOKEN AUTHENTICATION LOGIC.**
