# STRATEGIC MANDATE: The Cascade Protocol

**Purpose**: Synthesize historical data from 6 work orders into a unified, self-governing AI operational framework.  
**Governor**: Cascade  
**Location**: All work orders and reports in `Docs/02_State_of_the_Nation/`

---

## Overview

The ScraperSky repository's recent evolution, triggered by the WF7 crisis, presents a unique opportunity. The following six work orders are not just analytical tasks; they are the foundational pillars for **The Cascade Protocol**‚Äîan integrated governance system designed to make the architecture self-aware, self-healing, and self-documenting. 

This protocol will transform raw analysis into a dynamic operational framework, governed by Cascade, to ensure future AI assistants act with full historical context and architectural integrity.

## Work Order Strategic Blueprint

| Work Order | Title | Strategic Outcome | Phase |
|------------|-------|-------------------|-------|
| **WO_002** | WF7 Crisis Timeline Analysis | **Historical Foundation**: Internalize failure modes. | Phase 1 |
| **WO_001** | Persona Evolution Analysis | **Actor Governance**: Master persona evolution. | Phase 1 |
| **WO_003** | Pattern/AntiPattern Audit | **Defense Audit**: Validate violation safeguards. | Phase 2 |
| **WO_004** | V7 Migration Readiness | **Compliance Framework**: Codify naming conventions. | Phase 2 |
| **WO_006** | Git Status Pattern Analysis | **Diagnostic Engine**: Create a real-time health monitor. | Phase 3 |
| **WO_005** | Navigation Layer Design | **System Navigation**: Finalize the master map. | Phase 4 |

## Essential Documents

### Before Starting ANY Work Order
All assignees MUST read:
1. **The Guardian's Paradox** - `Docs/00_Constitution/0-Guardian_paradox_complete_story.md`
2. **The Knowledge Map** - `README.md` (Section: "üó∫Ô∏è Knowledge Map & Prescribed Paths")

## The Cascade Protocol: Vision & Execution

**Vision**: The Cascade Protocol is an active governance framework, not a set of static documents. By executing these work orders, Cascade will build an internalized, dynamic model of the system's history, actors, defenses, and health indicators. This model will be used to guide all future actions, enforce architectural integrity, and onboard future AI assistants with a complete, actionable understanding of the ecosystem.

### Strategic Execution Steps

### Day 1: Launch Phase 1 (Parallel)
```bash
# Morning - Launch both simultaneously
- Start WO_001 (librarian agent)
- Start WO_002 (Post-Mortem Specialist)
```

### Day 2: Launch Phase 2 (After WO_002 completes)
```bash
# When WO_002 delivers WF7 violations list
- Start WO_003 (Pattern Weaver) 
- Start WO_004 (Test Sentinel)
```

### Day 3: Launch Phase 3 (After Phase 2)
```bash
# When WO_003 and WO_004 complete
- Start WO_005 (The Architect)
```

### Anytime: Launch Phase 4
```bash
# Can run independently
- Start WO_006 (git-analyst)
```

## Critical Outputs

### Immediate Value (Day 1-2)
- **Emergency Playbook** from WO_002 - Broadcast to all AI assistants
- **Persona Version Matrix** from WO_001 - Understand evolution

### Navigation Foundation (Day 3-4)  
- **START_HERE_AI_ASSISTANT.md** from WO_005 - Onboarding for all future AI
- **Pattern Coverage Gaps** from WO_003 - What's still vulnerable

### Ongoing Monitoring
- **Git Diagnostic Guide** from WO_006 - Repository health monitoring
