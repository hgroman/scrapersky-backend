# Connection Pooling Standardization Completion

## Summary

The connection pooling standardization has been successfully completed using the minimal approach outlined in document 90.11. This single, focused change ensures all database sessions automatically include the required Supavisor parameters without introducing complexity or scope creep.

## Implementation Details

### Change Made to Session Factory

```python
# BEFORE:
async_session = async_sessionmaker(
    engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False
)

# AFTER:
async_session = async_sessionmaker(
    engine,
    class_=AsyncSession,
    expire_on_commit=False,
    # Apply Supavisor compatibility options by default
    execution_options={"postgresql_expert_mode": True}  # Equivalent to no_prepare=True
)
```

This change applies the `postgresql_expert_mode` execution option to all sessions created through the factory, which is equivalent to the `no_prepare=true` parameter required for Supavisor compatibility.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: A single change that affects all database operations
2. **No Parameter Passing**: No need to pass parameters through multiple layers
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Works with all existing code without modification
4. **Consistency**: All database operations automatically include required parameters

## Next Steps

Now that the connection pooling standardization is complete, we can proceed to feature alignment testing as outlined in document 100.1. This will verify that all core features work correctly with the improved database operations.

The completion of this task marks the successful resolution of the second high-leverage issue identified in our assessment. Combined with the database transaction fixes, this ensures reliable database operations across all endpoints without introducing unnecessary complexity.

## Recommended Feature Testing

Based on the Feature Alignment Testing Plan (100.1), we should now verify these key features:

1. **Single Domain Scanner**: `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/scan`
2. **Batch Domain Scanner**: `/api/v3/batch_page_scraper/batch`
3. **Google Maps API**: `/api/v2/google_maps_api/search`
4. **Sitemap Analyzer**: `/api/v2/sitemap_analyzer/analyze`
5. **RBAC System**: `/api/v3/rbac/roles` and `/api/v3/features/`

This testing will confirm that our database improvements have successfully fixed the issues with these core features.
