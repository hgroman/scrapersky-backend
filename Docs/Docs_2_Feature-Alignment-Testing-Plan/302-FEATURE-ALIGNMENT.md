I'm being asked to understand the big picture across all these documents and create a ScraperSky Feature Alignment Document that ties everything together. Let me analyze what I'm seeing:
The documents show a modernization project with multiple components:
Database transaction fixes
Connection pooling standardization
Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
API endpoint modernization
Legacy code cleanup
The Feature Alignment Document I created earlier mapped the business products from the press release to technical components:
LocalMiner & ContentMap ‚Üí Google Maps API, sitemap components
FrontendScout & SiteHarvest ‚Üí Page scraper components
EmailHunter & ContactLaunchpad ‚Üí Domain and profile services
ActionQueue & SocialRadar ‚Üí Job processing components
RBAC System ‚Üí Role-based access control components
The high-leverage action plan shows the priority is on making existing functionality work reliably, not adding new features.
The database transaction and connection pooling issues have been identified as critical blockers.
I should create a comprehensive Feature Alignment Document that:
Maps business features to technical components
Shows the current status of each feature
Indicates which modernization fixes are required for each feature
Provides a clear roadmap for completion
This document should serve as a "source of truth" that connects the business vision to the technical implementation while acknowledging the modernization work that's being completed.

# ScraperSky Feature Alignment & Modernization Status

## 1. Purpose

This document aligns ScraperSky's business products with their technical implementations, tracks modernization status, and outlines remaining work needed to complete the platform.

## 2. Feature-to-Technical Component Mapping

- **Session Management**: Apply consistent async session patterns

### 3.2 Authentication Standardization

- Unify auth implementation across all endpoints
- Ensure development token works consistently
- Complete RBAC integration with all endpoints

### 3.3 API Version Consolidation
