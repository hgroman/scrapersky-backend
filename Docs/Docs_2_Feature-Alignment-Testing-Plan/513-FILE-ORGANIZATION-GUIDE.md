# Feature Alignment Testing Plan - File Organization Guide

## Numbering System Explanation

This directory uses several numbering conventions for documentation, organized both chronologically and thematically:

### Major Series Overview

1. **00-0x** - Core context and implementation documents
   - Primary reference documents for project implementation
   - Created: March 20

2. **1.x** - Transaction Management and Feature Alignment
   - Detailed analysis of transaction boundary issues and fixes
   - Created: March 19-20

3. **90.x** - System Health Assessment and Connection Pooling
   - Initial system analysis and database connection improvements
   - Created: March 19

4. **10x.x** - Feature Alignment Implementation
   - Specific feature testing, authentication, and database session management
   - Created: March 19-20

5. **11x.x** - Endpoint Testing and API Standardization
   - API endpoint inventory, testing instructions, and standardization efforts
   - Created: March 20

### Detailed Series Breakdown

#### 00-0x Series: Core Implementation
- `00-CONTEXT-DOCUMENT.md` - Project overview
- `01-REFERENCE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Reference architecture
- `02-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - Implementation roadmap
- `03-RBAC-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` - Authentication integration
- `04-PROGRESS-TRACKING.md` - Project status

#### 1.x Series: Transaction Management
- `1.1` - `1.9` - Transaction management analysis and implementation
- `1.10` - `1.14` - Feature-specific transaction pattern application

#### 90.x Series: System Assessment
- `90.0` - `90.5` - System health assessment and recommendations
- `90.6` - `90.9` - Database transaction issue analysis and resolution
- `90.10` - `90.13` - Connection pooling standardization

#### 101.x-109.x Series: Feature Alignment Implementation
- `101.x` - Overall feature alignment planning
- `102.x` - Authentication standardization
- `103.x` - Database session management
- `104` - `109` - Specific component fixes and implementations

#### 110.x Series: Endpoint Testing Documentation
- `110.0` - Endpoint testing framework
- `110.1` - `110.3` - API-specific endpoint inventory and testing progress

#### 111.x Series: Router & API Standardization
- `111.0` - Router factory removal
- `111.1` - API standardization test plan
- `111.2` - Sitemap analyzer test instructions
- `111.3` - File organization documentation (this file)

## Standardization Reports

A series of implementation reports without specific numbering, focusing on standardization efforts for different components:

- RBAC components (Admin, Features, Permissions)
- Batch Page Scraper
- Domain Manager
- Legacy Routers
- DevTools

## Naming Convention Guidelines

When creating new files, please follow these conventions:

1. **New major topic**: Use the next available 10x.x series number (112.x would be next)
2. **Subtopic within existing area**: Use the next decimal within the appropriate series
3. **Standalone component report**: Use the `[Component]-Standardization-Report.md` format

## File Naming Format

- Use hyphen-separated words for clarity
- Use ALL-CAPS for primary categorization terms
- Include document type (GUIDE, PLAN, REPORT, etc.) at the end
- For numbered series, use consistent decimal places (111.0, 111.1, not 111, 111.1)

## Best Practices

1. Before creating a new file, review existing numbering to ensure proper sequence
2. Group related topics within the same number series
3. Update this guide when introducing new major number series
4. Reference related documents by their full filename when possible

This organizational system allows for both chronological tracking of the project's evolution and thematic grouping of related concepts, making it easier to navigate the extensive documentation.

*Note: This file organization guide was created on March 20, 2025, to establish clear documentation standards for the project. Future documentation should adhere to these conventions.*
