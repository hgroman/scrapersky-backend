# Transaction Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the "Routers own transaction boundaries, services do not" pattern across all major components of the ScraperSky backend. This architectural pattern standardizes transaction management, resolves transaction conflicts, and improves error handling throughout the application.

## Components Fixed

1. **FrontendScout**
   - `/src/routers/modernized_page_scraper.py`
   - `/src/services/page_scraper/processing_service.py`

2. **EmailHunter**
   - `/src/services/domain_service.py`

3. **SocialRadar**
   - `/src/services/batch/batch_processor_service.py`

4. **ActionQueue**
   - `/src/services/job_service.py`
   - `/src/routers/google_maps_api.py`

5. **ContentMap**
   - `/src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py`
   - `/src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py`
   - `/src/services/sitemap/sitemap_service.py`

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed Service Transaction Management:**
   - Removed `@managed_transaction` decorators from service methods
   - Eliminated direct transaction creation in services (except for background tasks)

2. **Added Transaction Awareness:**
   - Added `session.in_transaction()` checks in all service methods
   - Added logging of transaction state for debugging

3. **Ensured Router Transaction Boundaries:**
   - Added `async with session.begin():` blocks in router methods
   - Made sure router methods properly handle transaction exceptions

4. **Improved Background Task Transaction Handling:**
   - Made background tasks create their own sessions
   - Ensured proper transaction management in background tasks
   - Added checks for existing sessions vs. new sessions

5. **Enhanced Error Propagation:**
   - Ensured service methods propagate exceptions for transaction management
   - Added appropriate error logging

6. **Created Test Files:**
   - Added unit tests for transaction awareness
   - Added tests for router transaction management
   - Added tests for background task session handling
   - Added tests for exception propagation

## Pattern Implementation Details

The following pattern was consistently applied across all components:

### 1. Services:

```python
async def service_method(self, session: AsyncSession, ...):
    """
    Method documentation with transaction requirements.

    This method is transaction-aware and can be called from within an existing
    transaction or without a transaction. It will not start a new transaction.
    The caller (typically a router) is responsible for managing transaction boundaries.
    """
    # Check transaction state
    in_transaction = session.in_transaction()
    logger.debug(f"Session transaction state in service_method: {in_transaction}")

    try:
        # Service implementation
        # ...

        # Return result
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in service_method: {str(e)}")
        # Propagate exception for transaction management by caller
        raise
```

### 2. Routers:

```python
@router.post("/endpoint")
async def router_method(..., session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session)):
    """
    Router method documentation with transaction responsibility note.

    IMPORTANT: This router method owns the transaction boundaries.
    It wraps service calls in a transaction context, following the pattern:
    "Routers own transaction boundaries, services do not."
    """
    try:
        # Create transaction boundary
        async with session.begin():
            # Call service methods within transaction
            result = await service.method(session, ...)

        # Return response outside transaction
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in router_method: {str(e)}")
        # Handle error appropriately (e.g., return HTTP error response)
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### 3. Background Tasks:

```python
async def background_task_method(..., session: Optional[AsyncSession] = None):
    """
    Background task method that handles its own session and transaction.

    IMPORTANT: This method is an exception to the rule that services don't
    manage transactions, because it runs as a background task.
    """
    # Create a new session if one wasn't provided
    if session is None:
        session_ctx = async_session_factory()
        own_session = True
    else:
        session_ctx = session
        own_session = False

    try:
        # Use session as context manager if we created it
        if own_session:
            async with session_ctx as session:
                # Create transaction
                async with session.begin():
                    # Task implementation
                    # ...
        else:
            # Check if already in transaction
            in_transaction = session.in_transaction()

            if not in_transaction:
                # Create new transaction
                async with session.begin():
                    # Task implementation
                    # ...
            else:
                # Use existing transaction
                # Task implementation
                # ...

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error in background task: {str(e)}")
        # Handle error (e.g., update job status)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run All Tests:** Execute the complete test suite to verify changes
2. **Integration Testing:** Test components working together
3. **Deploy and Monitor:** Deploy changes and monitor transaction-related metrics
4. **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the new pattern

## Conclusion

The implementation of the "Routers own transaction boundaries, services do not" pattern has successfully standardized transaction management across the ScraperSky backend. This will result in more robust error handling, clearer responsibility boundaries, and reduced transaction conflicts.
