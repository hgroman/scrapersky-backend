# ScraperSky Backend Project Summary and Testing Plan

## Overview

The ScraperSky Backend is a Python-based API system built with FastAPI that provides services for web scraping, Google Maps API integration, and profile management. It implements a sophisticated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for authentication and authorization, feature flags for conditional functionality, and multi-tenant separation for data isolation.

## Recent Architectural Improvements

We've recently implemented significant architectural improvements focusing on:

1. **Transaction Management**: Proper handling of database transactions

   - Added explicit transaction contexts (`async with session.begin():`)
   - Ensured atomic operations and data consistency
   - Fixed transaction boundaries for multi-step operations

2. **Session Management**: Correct handling of database sessions

   - Fixed incorrect usage of `_AsyncGeneratorContextManager` objects
   - Implemented proper session dependency injection patterns
   - Properly scoped session lifetimes

3. **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connections

   - Properly configured SQLAlchemy connection pools
   - Ensured timely connection release
   - Prevented connection leaks

4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling across all components
   - Added consistent error handling patterns
   - Ensured proper transaction rollback on errors
   - Improved error logging and reporting

## Key Components and Improvements Made

### Profile Management System

- Added transaction contexts to all read/write operations
- Implemented proper error handling and rollback on failures
- Fixed concurrent access issues with proper transaction isolation

### Job Processing System

- Improved background task execution with proper session handling
- Fixed batch operations with transaction contexts
- Ensured job status updates are atomic and consistent

### RBAC System

- Updated all RBAC endpoints with proper transaction contexts
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Improved RBAC checks by placing them outside transaction blocks
- Enhanced tenant isolation for multi-tenant security

### Google Maps API Integration

- Fixed session handling in Google Maps API services
- Implemented transaction contexts for all database operations
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Existing Testing Infrastructure

We've created a comprehensive test suite with these modules:

1. **Test Utilities** (`scripts/tests/test_utils.py`)

   - Common functionality for all test scripts
   - HTTP client for API testing
   - Test result tracking and reporting
   - Error handling and logging

2. **Profile Management Tests** (`scripts/tests/test_profile_management.py`)

   - Tests read/write operations on profiles
   - Tests error handling
   - Tests transaction handling under concurrent access

3. **Job Processing System Tests** (`scripts/tests/test_job_processing.py`)

   - Tests job creation and status updates
   - Tests batch operations
   - Tests background task execution

4. **RBAC System Tests** (`scripts/tests/test_rbac_system.py`)

   - Tests role management CRUD operations
   - Tests permission assignments
   - Tests feature flag system
   - Tests tenant isolation

5. **Authentication Tests** (`scripts/tests/test_authentication.py`)

   - Tests token validation and rejection
   - Tests permission enforcement
   - Tests role-based access control
   - Tests tenant-specific access restrictions

6. **Main Test Runner** (`scripts/tests/run_all_tests.py`)

## What Needs Testing

We need to verify that our architectural improvements work as expected by running the test suite against a running instance of the ScraperSky backend. The test suite will verify:

1. **Transaction Handling**

   - Operations are properly wrapped in transactions
   - Failures cause rollbacks
   - Multi-step operations maintain consistency

2. **Session Management**

   - Sessions are properly created and closed
   - No session objects leak
   - Session dependencies work correctly

3. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - RBAC system enforces permissions correctly
   - Tenant isolation works properly
   - Feature flags control access appropriately

4. **Performance and Stability**
   - Connection pooling works efficiently
   - System handles concurrent operations
   - Error handling prevents crashes

## Instructions for Next Steps

1. Start the ScraperSky backend locally
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Run the comprehensive test suite (`./scripts/tests/run_all_tests.py`)
4. Analyze the test results for any failures
5. If failures occur, prioritize fixing transaction handling issues first, then session management, then RBAC issues

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (async)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase extensions
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with custom RBAC
- **Background Tasks**: FastAPI background tasks and async job processing

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code directory
  - `models/`: SQLAlchemy ORM models
  - `routers/`: FastAPI route handlers
  - `services/`: Business logic services
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
- `scripts/`: Utility and test scripts
  - `tests/`: Test suite modules

## Common Issues to Watch For

1. Incorrectly scoped transactions (too small or too large)
2. RBAC checks inside transaction blocks (should be outside)
3. Missing error handling in transaction blocks
4. Improper session creation or reuse
5. Tenant ID validation failures
6. Connection pool exhaustion under load

## Previous Bugs Fixed

1. `_AsyncGeneratorContextManager` objects incorrectly used as session objects
2. Missing `async with` blocks for transaction contexts
3. Multiple database operations not wrapped in single transactions
4. RBAC checks inside transaction blocks causing issues
5. Missing error handling causing connection leaks
6. Improper tenant isolation in multi-tenant scenarios
