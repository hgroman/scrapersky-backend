# ScraperSky Feature Alignment Plan

This document outlines the plan to ensure all ScraperSky components align with the architectural patterns and best practices demonstrated in the Google Maps API component. The goal is to achieve consistent modularity, RBAC integration, and transaction management across all routes and services.

## 1. Current Status Assessment

### 1.1 Successfully Aligned Components

The following components have already been successfully aligned with our architectural patterns:

- **Google Maps API** (reference implementation)
- **FrontendScout** (transaction management fixed)
- **EmailHunter** (transaction management fixed)
- **SocialRadar** (transaction management fixed)
- **ActionQueue** (transaction management fixed)
- **ContentMap** (transaction management fixed)

### 1.2 Components Requiring Alignment

Based on the transaction tests and codebase analysis, we need to focus on aligning the following components:

#### High Priority
- **Batch Page Scraper** (needs RBAC integration)
- **RBAC Admin** (needs transaction management standardization)
- **RBAC Features** (needs transaction management standardization)
- **RBAC Permissions** (needs transaction management standardization)

#### Medium Priority
- **Domain Manager** (needs service modularization)
- **DevTools** (needs RBAC integration)

#### Low Priority
- **Legacy routers** (needs to be phased out)

## 2. Alignment Strategies

### 2.1 Transaction Management Alignment

We've successfully implemented the "Routers own transaction boundaries, services do not" pattern across key components. For remaining components, we will:

1. **Analyze Current State:**
   - Review each component's transaction handling
   - Identify instances of services managing transactions

2. **Implement Transaction Awareness:**
   - Add transaction state checking to services
   - Refactor methods to propagate exceptions properly

3. **Update Router Transaction Management:**
   - Ensure routers explicitly manage transaction boundaries
   - Standardize transaction block usage

4. **Test Implementation:**
   - Add transaction tests following our test plan
   - Verify behavior in normal, error, and concurrent scenarios

### 2.2 RBAC Integration

For components lacking proper RBAC integration:

1. **Add Permission Checking Layers:**
   - Basic permission checks (`require_permission`)
   - Feature enablement checks (`require_feature_enabled`)
   - Role level checks (`require_role_level`)
   - Tab permission checks where applicable (`require_tab_permission`)

2. **Document Permissions:**
   - Add permission requirements to route docstrings
   - Update API documentation

3. **Test RBAC Implementation:**
   - Create tests for permission verification
   - Validate authorization flows

### 2.3 Service Modularization

For components with tightly coupled or monolithic services:

1. **Apply Layered Architecture:**
   - Separate router, service, and repository concerns
   - Move business logic from routers to services

2. **Implement Dependency Injection:**
   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection for services
   - Make dependencies explicit and testable

3. **Standardize Response Formats:**
   - Use consistent response models
   - Implement success/error patterns

4. **Test Modularized Implementation:**
   - Create unit tests for services
   - Verify router-service interactions

## 4. Task Assignment and Tracking

We should track progress using a task management system with the following categories:

1. **Transaction Management Tasks**
   - [ ] Component: Transaction Analysis
   - [ ] Component: Service Refactoring
   - [ ] Component: Router Updates
   - [ ] Component: Transaction Tests

2. **RBAC Integration Tasks**
   - [ ] Component: Permission Checks Implementation
   - [ ] Component: Permission Documentation
   - [ ] Component: RBAC Tests

3. **Service Modularization Tasks**
   - [ ] Component: Layer Separation
   - [ ] Component: Dependency Injection
   - [ ] Component: Service Unit Tests

4. **Documentation Tasks**
