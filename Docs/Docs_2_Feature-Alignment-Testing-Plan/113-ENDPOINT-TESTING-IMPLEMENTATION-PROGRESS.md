# ScraperSky API Endpoint Testing Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of endpoint testing for the ScraperSky backend.

## Testing Approach

We've implemented a multi-faceted testing approach for ScraperSky API endpoints:

1. **Interactive HTML Test Interface**: An enhanced version of the original API test demo page that allows testing of all major endpoints through a user-friendly interface
2. **Automated Bash Test Script**: A comprehensive shell script for testing endpoints via curl commands
3. **Detailed Logging**: Enhanced logging in critical components to help diagnose issues

## Endpoint Coverage

### Implemented Testing for the Following Endpoint Groups:

| Endpoint Group | Test Script | HTML Interface | Enhanced Logging |
|---------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Google Maps API | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Batch Page Scraper | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Sitemap | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| RBAC Features | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| RBAC Permissions | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| RBAC Roles | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Dev Tools | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Key Testing Assets

1. **Interactive Test Interface**: `/static/api-test-demo.html`
   - User-friendly interface for testing endpoints
   - Includes JWT token management
   - Real-time response viewing
   - Job status tracking
   - Support for all major API categories

2. **Bash Testing Script**: `/scripts/test_endpoints.sh`
   - Automated curl-based testing
   - Color-coded output for easy results interpretation
   - Comprehensive endpoint coverage
   - Sequential dependency testing (e.g., create job then check status)

3. **Diagnostic Script**: `/scripts/test_google_maps_service.py`
   - Focused testing for Google Maps API
   - Checks API key configuration
   - Tests job service operations
   - Detailed logging and diagnostics

## Google Maps API Issue Resolution

The issue with Google Maps API jobs remaining in "pending" status was diagnosed and fixed:

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging markers to identify where the process was failing
2. **API Key Handling**: Improved the Google Maps API key detection with fallback to settings
3. **Error Propagation**: Fixed error handling to prevent silent failures
4. **Transaction Context**: Ensured proper transaction handling in the background task

## Usage Instructions

### Interactive HTML Interface

1. Start the backend server with `python -m src.main`
2. Open the interface at http://localhost:8000/static/api-test-demo.html
3. Enter your JWT token in the Authentication section
4. Use the various tabs to test different endpoint categories

### Bash Testing Script

```bash
# Run with JWT token for full testing
./scripts/test_endpoints.sh <your_jwt_token>

# Run without token (limited testing)
./scripts/test_endpoints.sh
```

### Google Maps API Service Test

```bash
# Test Google Maps API and job service specifically
python scripts/test_google_maps_service.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Testing Coverage**: Add testing for remaining endpoints
2. **Test Automation**: Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
3. **Error Recovery Testing**: Add specific tests for error conditions and recovery
4. **Load Testing**: Implement load testing for critical endpoints
5. **Documentation Integration**: Link API documentation with test interfaces

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing framework now ensures that all major endpoints can be tested efficiently. The Google Maps API issue has been resolved, and the enhanced logging provides better diagnostic capabilities for future troubleshooting.
