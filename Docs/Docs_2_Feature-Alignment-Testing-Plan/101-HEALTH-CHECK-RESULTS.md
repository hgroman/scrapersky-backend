- Feature Flags: ✅ WORKING - (`/api/v3/features/`)
- Tenant Features: ✅ WORKING - (`/api/v3/features/tenant`)
- User Management: ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING - Database transaction issues observed

### Scraper Functionality

## Issues Identified

1. Database Transaction Issues: Some endpoints encountering "current transaction is aborted" errors
2. Authentication Inconsistencies: Some endpoints reject the development token
3. API Version Discrepancies: Confusion between v2 and v3 endpoint versions

## Next Steps

1. Test remaining API endpoints
2. Create database transaction handling recommendations
3. Complete documentation for API endpoint assessment
4. Identify legacy code that should be cleaned up
