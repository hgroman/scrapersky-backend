# ScraperSky Endpoint Testing and Documentation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive test interfaces for all standardized endpoints in the ScraperSky backend. The goal is to provide a way to:

1. Test each endpoint manually with a user-friendly interface
2. Document endpoint functionality, permissions, and database relationships
3. Generate CURL commands for automated testing and frontend integration
4. Verify that the standardization work has been implemented correctly

## Phase 1: Endpoint Inventory and Analysis

### Tasks

1. **Create an endpoint inventory**
   - Document all endpoints by router
   - Categorize by functionality (CRUD, search, etc.)
   - Identify permission requirements 
   - Map database tables and relationships
   - Identify RBAC implications

2. **Generate CURL command templates**
   - Create reusable CURL commands for each endpoint
   - Document required headers and payload formats
   - Include examples of successful and error responses
   - Document tenant isolation requirements

3. **Analyze frontend integration requirements**
   - Identify which endpoints need HTML test interfaces
   - Define necessary UI components for each endpoint
   - Map relationships between endpoints for complete workflows

## Phase 2: HTML Test Interface Development

### Tasks

1. **Create a consistent template system**
   - Develop a standardized HTML template for endpoint testing
   - Include sections for:
     - Endpoint documentation
     - CURL command examples
     - Permission requirements
     - Database tables and fields
     - Interactive testing form
     - Response display
     - Request history

2. **Implement test interfaces organized by domain**
   - Create separate HTML pages for related endpoint groups:
     - Google Maps API
     - Batch Page Scraper
     - Modernized Sitemap
     - RBAC Admin
     - RBAC Features
     - RBAC Permissions
     - Profile Management
     - Dev Tools
     - Etc.

3. **Add comprehensive documentation to each interface**
   - Include detailed descriptions of each endpoint
   - Document required permissions and RBAC implications
   - Show database schema diagrams for related tables
   - Explain tenant isolation requirements

## Phase 3: Automated Testing Framework

### Tasks

1. **Create a test script generator**
   - Tool to generate bash scripts from CURL templates
   - Option to run individual or batched tests
   - Capture and validate responses

2. **Implement a test results dashboard**
   - Visual display of test results
   - Historical test data
   - Success/failure metrics
   - Performance benchmarks

3. **Develop continuous validation tools**
   - Scripts that can be integrated into CI/CD
   - Automatic validation of API contracts
   - Regression testing framework

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Endpoint Inventory and Documentation
- Complete full endpoint inventory
- Document permission requirements
- Map database relationships
- Generate CURL command templates

### Week 2: Basic HTML Test Interfaces
- Create HTML template system
- Implement first set of test interfaces (high-priority endpoints)
- Validate with manual testing

### Week 3: Complete Test Suite
- Finish remaining test interfaces
- Implement automated testing framework
- Create test results dashboard

### Week 4: System Validation and Optimization
- Comprehensive testing of all endpoints
- Fix any discovered issues
- Optimize test interfaces for usability
- Final documentation update

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Endpoint Inventory Document**
   - Complete catalog of all endpoints with metadata
   - Database relationship diagrams
   - Permission requirements matrix

2. **HTML Test Interfaces**
   - One HTML page per logical endpoint group
   - Interactive forms for testing
   - Comprehensive documentation embedded in each page

3. **CURL Command Library**
   - Collection of CURL commands for all endpoints
   - Organized by functionality
   - Includes both successful and error test cases

4. **Automated Test Scripts**
   - Bash scripts for endpoint validation
   - Integration with CI/CD pipeline
   - Test results dashboard

5. **Integration Guide for Frontend Developers**
   - Documentation connecting backend endpoints to frontend needs
   - Example code for frontend integration
   - Common patterns and best practices

## Success Criteria

1. All standardized endpoints are documented and testable via HTML interfaces
2. CURL commands are available for each endpoint
3. Database relationships and RBAC implications are clearly documented
4. Frontend developers can use the documentation to integrate with endpoints
5. All test interfaces are functional and user-friendly
6. Automated test scripts validate endpoint functionality

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Begin endpoint inventory for each router module
2. Develop the HTML template system
3. Create the first test interface for the Google Maps API as a prototype
4. Review with stakeholders for feedback
