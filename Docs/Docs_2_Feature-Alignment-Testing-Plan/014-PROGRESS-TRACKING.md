2. Added comprehensive four-layer RBAC checks to all endpoints
3. Improved error handling and logging
4. Updated tests to verify the standardized patterns

### Phase 3 Progress

1. Successfully standardized the Batch Page Scraper component with proper transaction boundaries
2. Implemented comprehensive four-layer RBAC checks for all endpoints
3. Improved error handling in both router and service layers
4. Added background task patterns with proper session management
5. Updated tests to verify transaction boundaries and RBAC integration

### Phase 4 Progress

1. Successfully standardized the Domain Manager component with proper transaction boundaries
2. Implemented comprehensive four-layer RBAC checks for all endpoints
3. Improved error handling in both router and service layers
4. Enhanced background task implementations with proper session and transaction management
5. Created transaction, RBAC, and error handling tests
6. Enhanced documentation across all files for better maintainability

### Phase 5 Progress

1. Successfully standardized the DevTools component with a pragmatic approach
2. Applied essential transaction boundaries to all database-interacting endpoints
3. Implemented appropriate RBAC checks focused on core permissions
4. Updated API versioning for consistency
5. Created minimal but effective tests for critical functionality
6. Prepared concise documentation focused on essential information

### Phase 6 Progress

3. Added proper obsolescence notices to sitemap_router
4. Implemented deprecation headers for smooth API transition
5. Created deprecation and migration documentation
6. Completed the standardization project at 100%

### Challenges and Solutions

1. Challenge: Ensuring consistent RBAC layer ordering across all routes
   - Solution: Implemented and documented the four-layer RBAC pattern
2. Challenge: Maintaining proper transaction awareness without transaction management
   - Solution: Added transaction state checking with session.in_transaction()
3. Challenge: Test failures after adding additional RBAC checks
   - Solution: Updated tests to mock all four RBAC check layers
4. Challenge: Proper background task implementation with transactions
   - Solution: Ensured background tasks create their own sessions and manage their own transactions
5. Challenge: Integrating standardization patterns with legacy database access code
   - Solution: Added transaction awareness to legacy code without breaking compatibility
6. Challenge: Handling not-implemented endpoints during standardization
   - Solution: Applied standardized patterns while preserving not-implemented status for future implementation

## Project Completion

The ScraperSky API Standardization Project has been successfully completed with all components standardized according to the architectural patterns defined in the reference implementation. The completion tasks included:

1. **Legacy Router Standardization**
   - Evaluated and classified all legacy routers
   - Applied flag-and-defer approach with proper deprecation notices
   - Created migration paths for frontend integrations
   - Added HTTP deprecation headers for smooth transition

2. **Final Verification**
   - Verified all standardized components function correctly
   - Ensured deprecation notices work as expected
   - Checked documentation completeness and accuracy

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created comprehensive component standardization reports
   - Updated progress tracking and metrics
   - Created a project completion summary
   - Documented migration paths for legacy components
