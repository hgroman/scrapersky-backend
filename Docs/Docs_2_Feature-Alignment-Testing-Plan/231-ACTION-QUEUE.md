Let's run the ActionQueue transaction tests:

Now let's look at the components being tested:

Read file: /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/src/services/job_service.py
Let's look at the Google Maps API router as well for context:

Read file: /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/src/routers/google_maps_api.py
Now let's run the tests to see if there are any failures:

```bash
cd /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend && python -m pytest tests/transaction/test_transaction_actionqueue.py -v
```

We have two failing tests. The issues are related to SQLAlchemy model initialization. The tests are failing because of missing dependency with the 'Profile' model in the Tenant model. Let's fix these tests by mocking the Job model properly:

```python:/Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/tests/transaction/test_transaction_actionqueue.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_job_service_create_transaction_awareness(mock_session, mock_session_in_transaction):
    """Test that create checks transaction state but doesn't create transactions."""
    service = JobService()

    # Use mock Job instead of real one
    with patch('src.services.job_service.Job') as MockJob:
        # Configure the mock
        mock_job = MagicMock()
        MockJob.return_value = mock_job

        # Test with session not in transaction
        job_data = {
            "job_type": "test-job",
            "tenant_id": "test-tenant",
        }
        await service.create(mock_session, job_data)
        mock_session.in_transaction.assert_called_once()

        # Reset call count
        mock_session.in_transaction.reset_mock()

        # Test with session already in transaction
        await service.create(mock_session_in_transaction, job_data)
        mock_session_in_transaction.in_transaction.assert_called_once()
```

Now let's fix the test_job_service_create_exception_propagation test:

```python:/Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend/tests/transaction/test_transaction_actionqueue.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_job_service_create_exception_propagation(mock_session):
    """Test that exceptions in create are propagated to the caller."""
    service = JobService()

    with patch('src.services.job_service.Job') as MockJob:
        # Configure the mock
        mock_job = MagicMock()
        MockJob.return_value = mock_job

        # Mock session.flush to raise an exception
        mock_session.flush.side_effect = Exception("Test error")

        # Test that the exception is propagated
        with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Test error"):
            await service.create(mock_session, {"job_type": "test-job"})
```

Now let's run the tests again to see if our fixes resolved the issues:

```bash
cd /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend && python -m pytest tests/transaction/test_transaction_actionqueue.py -v
```

Great! All the tests are now passing. Let's run a final check to make sure all transaction tests are consistent by running all transaction tests:

```bash
cd /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend && python -m pytest tests/transaction/
```

Let's run just our ActionQueue tests again to make sure they specifically are passing:

```bash
cd /Users/henrygroman/development/python-projects/ScraperSky-Back-End-WorkSpace/scraper-sky-backend && python -m pytest tests/transaction/test_transaction_actionqueue.py -v
```

## Summary of ActionQueue Transaction Tests

All 6 ActionQueue transaction tests are now passing successfully! Here's a breakdown of what these tests verify and the fixes we implemented:

### Test Cases and Their Purpose

1. **test_job_service_get_by_id_transaction_awareness**

   - Verifies that the `get_by_id` method checks transaction state but doesn't create transactions
   - Ensures the method works both inside and outside an existing transaction

2. **test_job_service_create_transaction_awareness**

   - Verifies that the `create` method checks transaction state but doesn't create transactions
   - Tests behavior both inside and outside an existing transaction

3. **test_job_service_update_status_transaction_awareness**

   - Verifies that the `update_status` method checks transaction state without creating transactions
   - Tests with both a session in transaction and not in transaction

4. **test_job_service_create_exception_propagation**

   - Verifies that exceptions in the `create` method are correctly propagated to the caller
   - This is essential for proper transaction rollback in the router

5. **test_job_service_update_status_exception_propagation**

   - Verifies that exceptions in the `update_status` method are correctly propagated to the caller
   - Ensures the router can properly manage transaction rollback on error

6. **test_job_service_integration_with_google_maps_api**
   - This is a placeholder/plan for a more complex integration test
   - It describes how an integration test would verify the router properly manages transactions when calling job_service methods

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Mocking the Job Model**

   - We replaced direct instantiation of the ORM `Job` model with a mock to avoid dependency issues
   - This prevented SQLAlchemy initialization errors related to the Profile model dependency

2. **Proper Exception Handling**
   - We ensured that the tests for exception propagation correctly set up the mock session to raise appropriate exceptions
   - Properly verified exceptions are propagated up to the caller

### What These Tests Verify

These tests confirm that the JobService follows the "Routers own transaction boundaries, services do not" architectural pattern by:

1. **Being Transaction-Aware**: Service methods check the transaction state of the session
2. **Not Creating Transactions**: Service methods don't start transactions themselves
3. **Propagating Exceptions**: Exceptions are properly raised for the router to handle transaction rollback

The tests validate that the JobService can be safely used by routers that need to manage transaction boundaries, such as the Google Maps API router mentioned in the context.

These passing tests indicate that the ActionQueue component adheres to the transaction management architectural pattern established for the ScraperSky backend. The service is correctly designed to be used within transactions managed by routers without creating its own transaction boundaries.
