## 7. NEXT ACTIONS

1. âœ… Completed: `src/db/sitemap_handler.py`:
   - [x] Reviewed current implementation
   - [x] Made service transaction-aware with session parameter
   - [x] Removed internal session creation
   - [x] Standardized SQL parameter naming

2. Next priority: `src/routers/sitemap_analyzer.py`:
   - [ ] Add transaction boundaries at router level
   - [ ] Replace raw SQL string concatenation with db_service
   - [ ] Add proper session dependency injection
   - [ ] Test changes thoroughly 

3. Then `src/routers/db_portal.py`:
   - [ ] Add router-owned transaction boundaries
   - [ ] Ensure proper session dependency injection
   - [ ] Update to use db_service consistently
   - [ ] Test changes thoroughly

## 8. SESSION NOTES

### 2025-03-24 Session

1. Created documentation structure in DB_CONSOLIDATION directory:
   - `00-MASTER-REFERENCE.md` - Main reference document
   - `01-DATABASE-ROUTES-AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive audit of router files
   - `02-PROGRESS-TRACKER.md` - This progress tracking document
   - `03-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

2. Completed first high-priority file: `src/db/sitemap_handler.py`
   - Updated all methods to accept SQLAlchemy session parameter
   - Removed internal session creation (using get_session())
   - Made service transaction-aware by removing commit calls
   - The handler is now properly transaction-aware
   
3. Next file to work on: `src/routers/sitemap_analyzer.py`
   - Will need to focus on replacing direct SQL with db_service calls
   - Security critical: Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries
   - Add transaction boundaries owned by the router
