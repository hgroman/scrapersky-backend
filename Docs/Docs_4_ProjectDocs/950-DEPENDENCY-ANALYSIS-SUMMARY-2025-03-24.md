# ScraperSky Backend Dependency Analysis Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the dependency analysis conducted on March 24, 2025, to identify unused files, duplicate services, and cleanup opportunities in the ScraperSky backend codebase. The analysis involved tracing dependencies from the main.py file to all active routers and their supporting services.

## Key Findings

1. **Active Routers**: 7 routers are actively being used in the application
   - Google Maps API router
   - Modernized Sitemap router
   - Batch Page Scraper router
   - Dev Tools router
   - DB Portal router
   - Profile router
   - SQLAlchemy test router

2. **Backup Files**: 3 backup files were identified that can be safely removed
   - `/src/session/async_session.py.bak`
   - `/src/services/sitemap/processing_service.py.bak`
   - `/src/routers/modernized_sitemap.bak.3.21.25.py` (already removed)

3. **Duplicate Services**: Multiple duplicate service implementations were found
   - Error services (3 implementations)
   - Validation services (3 implementations)
   - Database services (2 implementations)

4. **Obsolete Code**: Several obsolete files were identified
   - `/src/routers/page_scraper.py` (already removed)
   - `/src/routers/sitemap.py` (legacy version)
   - `/src/db/sitemap_handler_fixed.py` (already removed)

5. **Service Directories**: Multiple directories containing similar services
   - `/src/services/core/` (primary services)
   - `/src/services/new/` (duplicate services)
   - `/src/services/error/` (duplicate error services)
   - `/src/services/validation/` (duplicate validation services)

## Implementation Plan

A comprehensive cleanup plan has been documented in [948-FILE-CLEANUP-PLAN-2025-03-24.md](./948-FILE-CLEANUP-PLAN-2025-03-24.md), with the following key components:

1. **Phase 1**: Remove backup files
2. **Phase 2**: Consolidate service implementations
3. **Phase 3**: Remove obsolete code
4. **Phase 4**: Consolidate service directories

A cleanup script has been created at `/scripts/cleanup_files.py` to automate this process, with a dry-run option to preview changes before applying them.

## Dependency Matrix

A detailed dependency matrix showing the relationships between routers and their supporting services has been documented in [949-DEPENDENCY-MATRIX-2025-03-24.md](./949-DEPENDENCY-MATRIX-2025-03-24.md). This matrix provides a clear view of which files are actively used and which ones are candidates for removal.

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified codebase**: Removing duplicate and obsolete files will make the codebase more maintainable
2. **Reduced confusion**: Developers will have a clearer understanding of which services to use
3. **Improved onboarding**: New developers will be able to understand the codebase more quickly
4. **Smaller deployment footprint**: The application will have fewer files to deploy and manage
5. **Better testability**: With fewer components, testing will be more straightforward

## Verification Process

To ensure the cleanup does not break existing functionality, the following steps are recommended:

1. Run all tests before and after each phase
2. Use the dry-run option of the cleanup script to preview changes
3. Archive files rather than deleting them initially, to easily revert if issues arise
4. Perform manual testing of key application features after cleanup

## Next Steps

1. **Implement the cleanup plan** using the provided script
2. **Update import statements** throughout the codebase to reference the consolidated services
3. **Remove empty directories** after all files have been moved or archived
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the new, simplified codebase structure
5. **Enhance test coverage** to catch any regressions

## Conclusion

The dependency analysis has provided a clear picture of which files are actively used in the application and which can be safely removed or consolidated. Implementing the cleanup plan will result in a more maintainable, understandable, and efficient codebase.
