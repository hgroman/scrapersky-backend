# Next Steps for ScraperSky Backend (2025-03-25)

This document outlines the current state of the ScraperSky Backend project and prioritizes the next actions to take. It serves as a comprehensive guide for ongoing development efforts.

## Current State Overview

The ScraperSky Backend has undergone significant consolidation and standardization:

1. **Core Services Consolidation**: Eliminated duplicate implementations of error handling, authentication, and database access services
2. **Transaction Management**: Implemented consistent patterns for database transactions with clear ownership boundaries
3. **API Standardization**: Standardized all endpoints to v3 with consistent naming and response formats
4. **Tenant Isolation Removal**: Simplified the codebase by removing multi-tenant isolation mechanisms
5. **Connection Pooling**: Implemented proper connection pooling for database access
6. **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with proper FastAPI integration

## Critical Issues Addressed

1. **Database Schema Type Mismatches**: Fixed type mismatches between application and database for UUID fields
2. **Job ID Generation**: Standardized job_id generation to use proper UUIDs
3. **Transaction Boundaries**: Clarified transaction boundaries with explicit commit/rollback
4. **Authentication Boundary**: Enforced JWT authentication ONLY at API router level

## Immediate Priority Actions

1. **UUID Standardization** (HIGH)
   - Convert all job_id fields to proper UUID format
   - Update job service for standard UUID handling
   - Standardize Domain Service UUID patterns

2. **Authentication Boundary Enforcement** (HIGH)
   - Complete review of all routers to ensure JWT authentication at router level only
   - Remove any service-level authentication
   - Update documentation to reflect authentication boundary principles

3. **Testing Infrastructure** (HIGH)
   - Complete Google Maps API testing script
   - Develop additional service test scripts
   - Implement transaction boundary tests

## Medium-Term Priorities

1. **Service Standardization** (MEDIUM)
   - Complete Job Service standardization
   - Review and update Domain Service
   - Standardize remaining Core Services
   - Improve error handling consistency

2. **Performance Optimization** (MEDIUM)
   - Fine-tune connection pooling
   - Optimize database queries
   - Refine transaction boundaries

3. **Documentation Updates** (MEDIUM)
   - Update API documentation
   - Create comprehensive architectural reference
   - Document standard patterns for new developers

## Long-Term Initiatives

1. **Monitoring and Observability** (LOW)
   - Implement enhanced logging
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Create monitoring dashboards

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Improvements** (LOW)
   - Enhance automated testing
   - Improve deployment automation
   - Implement canary deployments

3. **Feature Development** (LOW)
   - Add new analytics capabilities
   - Implement enhanced data visualization
   - Develop batch processing improvements

## Reference Architecture Principles

1. **Transaction Ownership**: Routers own transactions, services are transaction-aware
2. **Session Management**: Dependency injection for sessions, proper session lifecycle
3. **Authentication Boundary**: JWT authentication ONLY at API router level, never in services
4. **UUID Standardization**: All UUIDs must be proper PostgreSQL UUIDs, no custom formats
5. **Pooled Connections**: All database connections must use connection pooling

## Team Assignments

_Note: Update with actual team member assignments when available._

- **UUID Standardization**: TBD
- **Authentication Boundary**: TBD
- **Testing Infrastructure**: TBD
- **Service Standardization**: TBD
- **Performance Optimization**: TBD
- **Documentation Updates**: TBD

## Success Metrics

1. **Codebase Health**:
   - Zero direct Supabase connections (all through SQLAlchemy)
   - 100% of UUIDs using proper PostgreSQL UUID format
   - 100% of authentication at router level only
   - Zero transaction leaks in testing

2. **Performance**:
   - 30% reduction in database connection overhead
   - 20% improvement in response times for key endpoints
   - 50% reduction in connection pool exhaustion events

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - 40% reduction in onboarding time for new developers
   - 25% reduction in time to implement new features
   - 50% reduction in bugs related to database transactions

## Status Tracking

Weekly status updates will be provided with progress on the key priorities. These will be documented in the project-docs directory with clear naming conventions.
