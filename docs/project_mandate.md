# ScraperSky Backend Project Mandate

## Core Functionality Preservation

- Maintain existing single URL processing via `/scrapersky` endpoint
- Preserve current job tracking and status reporting system
- Keep current metadata extraction and database storage process intact
- Ensure backward compatibility for all existing integrations

## Parallel Processing Enhancement

### New Capability

- Add `/scrapersky/batch` endpoint for multiple URL processing
- Enable concurrent processing of multiple domains
- Implement parallel ScraperAPI calls (respecting rate limits)
- Optimize database operations for batch processing

### Processing Flow

Current (Sequential):

```
URL1 → URL2 → URL3 → URL4 (one after another)
```

Target (Concurrent):

```
URL1 ─┐
URL2 ─┼─► Parallel Processing
URL3 ─┘
```

## Performance Requirements

1. Concurrent URL Processing

   - Multiple URLs processed simultaneously
   - Significant reduction in total processing time
   - Efficient resource utilization

2. Database Operations

   - Batch inserts where possible
   - Maintain data consistency
   - Optimize connection pooling

3. API Integration
   - Respect ScraperAPI rate limits
   - Handle concurrent API calls efficiently
   - Manage API resource usage

## Error Handling & Monitoring

- Individual URL failure isolation
- Batch job status tracking
- Per-URL status reporting
- Comprehensive error logging
- Failure recovery mechanisms

## Success Metrics

1. Processing Time

   - Measurable reduction in total processing time for multiple URLs
   - Efficient resource utilization under load

2. Reliability

   - Maintain current success rate for individual URL processing
   - Robust error handling for batch operations
   - System stability under concurrent load

3. Scalability
   - Handle increasing batch sizes efficiently
   - Graceful performance degradation under heavy load
   - Resource-aware processing limits

## Implementation Priorities

1. Preserve existing functionality
2. Add concurrent processing capability
3. Optimize database operations
4. Enhance monitoring and error handling
5. Implement performance safeguards

This mandate serves as the guiding document for the ScraperSky backend enhancement project, focusing on adding efficient batch processing while maintaining existing functionality.
