# Authentication & Authorization Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers the authentication and authorization system implemented in the ScraperSky backend. It provides detailed information on the technical implementation, database architecture, user management, and developer guidelines.

## Documentation Sections

### [Technical Specification](technical_specification.md)

Detailed technical documentation covering:

- Authentication issues and debugging
- JWT validation implementation
- API key fallback authentication
- Tenant ID validation
- Database migrations
- API endpoints
- Testing approach

### [Database Architecture](database_architecture.md)

Comprehensive database documentation covering:

- Table structures and relationships
- Entity relationship diagram
- Data flow for authentication
- Tenant isolation implementation
- Data type standardization

### [User Guide](user_guide.md)

User-focused documentation covering:

- Authentication methods
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Role-based access control
- Onboarding process for tenants and users
- User and tenant management
- Troubleshooting and best practices

### [Implementation Guide for Developers](implementation_guide.md)

Developer-focused documentation covering:

- Adding authentication to routes
- Tenant ID validation
- Permission-based authorization
- Multi-tenant data access
- Error handling
- Testing with authentication
- Best practices

## Key Takeaways

1. **All Routes Must Use Authentication**: Every API endpoint must use the authentication module for consistent security and tenant isolation.

2. **Tenant Isolation is Critical**: All data access must be filtered by tenant_id to ensure proper multi-tenant operation.

3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Use permission checks for sensitive operations to ensure proper authorization.

4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Handle authentication and authorization errors gracefully with proper logging and user-friendly messages.

## Getting Started

For developers new to the system, start with the [Implementation Guide](implementation_guide.md) to understand how to use the authentication module in your code.

For administrators and operations staff, the [User Guide](user_guide.md) provides information on managing users, tenants, and permissions.

For technical architects and those interested in the implementation details, the [Technical Specification](technical_specification.md) and [Database Architecture](database_architecture.md) documents provide in-depth information.
