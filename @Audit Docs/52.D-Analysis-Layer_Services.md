# Service Layer: Workflow Touchpoints

This document maps which service files and key functions are utilized by each of the six core workflows (WF1-WF6), along with the primary purpose of that interaction within the workflow. It is based on information from Canonical YAML files and Dependency Traces.

## WF1-SingleSearch

_Based on Dependency Trace: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/WF1-Single Search.md`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/places/places_search_service.py`
    - **Function:** `search_and_store(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF1:** Orchestrates the Google Maps API search (via `PlacesService`) and storing results (via `PlacesStorageService`). This is called by a background task initiated by the `google_maps_api.py` router.
  - `src/services/places/places_service.py`
    - **Function:** `search_places(...)` (or similar)
      - **Purpose within WF1:** Directly interacts with the external Google Maps API to fetch place data.
  - `src/services/places/places_storage_service.py`
    - **Function:** `store_places(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF1:** Saves retrieved place data (from Google Maps search) to the database.

## WF2-StagingEditor

_Based on Canonical YAML: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF2-StagingEditor_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
    - **Function:** `process_pending_jobs()` (specifically the section for "Process Pending Deep Scans")
      - **Purpose within WF2:** Polls the `places` table for records with `deep_scan_status='Queued'` (set by the `places_staging.py` router) and initiates their processing.
  - `src/services/places_deep_service.py`
    - **Function:** `process_single_deep_scan(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF2:** Called by `sitemap_scheduler.py` to perform the actual deep scan logic for an individual `Place` record.

## WF3-LocalBusinessCuration

_Based on Canonical YAML: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF3-LocalBusinessCuration_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py`
    - **Function:** `process_pending_jobs()` (specifically the section for "Process Pending Domain Extractions")
      - **Purpose within WF3:** Polls the `local_businesses` table for records with `domain_extraction_status='Queued'` (set by the `local_businesses.py` router) and initiates their processing.
  - `src/services/business_to_domain_service.py`
    - **Function:** `process_single_business(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF3:** Called by `sitemap_scheduler.py` to extract domain information from a `LocalBusiness` record and create/update a corresponding `Domain` record.

## WF4-DomainCuration

_Based on Canonical YAML: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF4-DomainCuration_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py`
    - **Function:** `process_pending_sitemap_submissions()`
      - **Purpose within WF4:** Polls the `domains` table for records with `sitemap_analysis_status='Queued'` (set by the `domains.py` router) and initiates their processing.
  - `src/services/domain_to_sitemap_adapter_service.py`
    - **Function:** `submit_domain_for_sitemap_scan(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF4:** Called by `domain_sitemap_submission_scheduler.py` to submit a domain for sitemap analysis, potentially to an external system or another internal service like `sitemap.processing_service.py` (which is noted as a potential target in the `WF4-Domain Curation.md` Dependency Trace).

## WF5-SitemapCuration

_Based on Canonical YAML: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/workflows/WF5-SitemapCuration_CANONICAL.yaml`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/sitemap_files_service.py`
    - **Function:** `update_curation_status_batch(...)`
      - **Purpose within WF5:** Handles the business logic when a user updates the `deep_scrape_curation_status` of `SitemapFile` records via the `sitemap_files.py` router. This service implements the dual-status update, setting `sitemap_import_status='Queued'` if the curation status becomes "Selected".
  - `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py` (Consumer for WF5's output, part of WF6)
    - **Function:** `process_pending_sitemap_imports()` (or similar, as per WF6 logic)
      - **Purpose:** Polls `sitemap_files` for `sitemap_import_status='Queued'` items (produced by WF5) to initiate WF6.

## WF6-SitemapImport

_Based on Dependency Trace: `Docs/Docs_7_Workflow_Canon/Dependency_Traces/WF6-SitemapImport_dependency_trace.md`_

- **Service File(s) & Key Functions:**
  - `src/services/sitemap_import_scheduler.py`
    - **Function:** (e.g., `process_pending_sitemap_imports()` - actual name from scheduler file needed)
      - **Purpose within WF6:** Polls the `sitemap_files` table for records with `sitemap_import_status='Queued'` (set by WF5 via `sitemap_files_service.py`) and initiates their processing.
  - `src/services/sitemap_import_service.py`
    - **Function:** (e.g., `process_single_sitemap_file_import()` - actual name from service file needed)
      - **Purpose within WF6:** Fetches the content of an individual sitemap file, parses URLs, and creates corresponding `Page` records in the database.
  - `src/common/sitemap_parser.py`
    - **Function/Class:** (Utility for parsing sitemap XML)
      - **Purpose within WF6:** Provides sitemap parsing capabilities used by `sitemap_import_service.py`.
  - `src/common/curation_sdk/scheduler_loop.py`
    - **Function:** `run_job_loop`
      - **Purpose within WF6:** A reusable utility likely employed by `sitemap_import_scheduler.py` for standardized batch processing of queued sitemap files.
