# API Router Layer: Workflow Touchpoints

This document maps which API router files and specific endpoints are utilized by each of the six core workflows (WF1-WF6), along with the purpose of that interaction within the workflow. It also lists other routers and their general system purpose.

## WF1-SingleSearch

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/google_maps_api.py`
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/places`
      - **Purpose within WF1:** Initiates a new single business discovery search. The router creates a `PlaceSearch` job record and triggers background processing of the search and storage of results.
    - **Endpoint (Implied for Status Polling):** `GET /api/v3/localminer-discoveryscan/search/status/{job_id}`
      - **Purpose within WF1:** Allows the client to poll for the status of the initiated search job.

## WF2-StagingEditor

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/places_staging.py`
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v3/places/staging/status`
      - **Purpose within WF2:** Receives batch updates for `Place` statuses from the Staging Editor UI. If the primary status is updated to "Selected", this endpoint's logic sets the `deep_scan_status` to "Queued", making the places eligible for deep scan processing by a background scheduler.

## WF3-LocalBusinessCuration

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/local_businesses.py`
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v3/local-businesses/status`
      - **Purpose within WF3:** Receives batch updates for `LocalBusiness` statuses from the Local Business Curation UI. If the primary status is updated to "Selected", this endpoint's logic sets the `domain_extraction_status` to "Queued", making the businesses eligible for domain extraction processing by a background scheduler.

## WF4-DomainCuration

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/domains.py`
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v3/domains/sitemap-curation/status`
      - **Purpose within WF4:** Receives batch updates for `Domain` sitemap curation statuses from the Domain Curation UI. If the `sitemap_curation_status` is updated to "Selected", this endpoint's logic sets the `sitemap_analysis_status` to "Queued", making the domains eligible for sitemap analysis by a background scheduler.

## WF5-SitemapCuration

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/sitemap_files.py`
    - **Endpoint:** `PUT /api/v3/sitemap-files/status`
      - **Purpose within WF5:** Receives batch updates for `SitemapFile` `deep_scrape_curation_status` from the Sitemap Curation UI. If the status is set to "Selected", the service layer called by this endpoint sets the `deep_scrape_process_status` to "Queued".
  - `src/routers/modernized_sitemap.py` (Potentially, as an entry point for direct sitemap scans)
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v3/sitemap/scan`
      - **Purpose within WF5:** Allows initiating a new sitemap scan for a domain, which would then result in `SitemapFile` records that can be curated.
    - **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v3/sitemap/status/{job_id}`
      - **Purpose within WF5:** Checks the status of a sitemap scan job initiated via the `/scan` endpoint.

## WF6-SitemapImport

- **Router File(s):**
  - `src/routers/sitemap_files.py` (Implied Interaction)
    - **Endpoint(s) for Curation:** Endpoints within this router (like `PUT /api/v3/sitemap-files/status` used by WF5) are responsible for setting the `sitemap_import_status` to `Queued` (or a similar status that WF6's scheduler polls for) on `SitemapFile` records, making them eligible for the import process.
  - `src/routers/dev_tools.py`
    - **Endpoint(s):** Contains development/testing endpoints that can manually trigger the sitemap import process for specific sitemap files.
      - **Purpose within WF6:** Facilitates testing and debugging of the import scheduler and service logic, not part of the primary automated workflow.
  - `src/routers/batch_sitemap.py` (Potential Involvement)
    - **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v3/sitemap/batch/create`
      - **Purpose within WF6 (Potential):** Could be used for initiating batch imports or processing of multiple sitemaps, which would then feed into the WF6 pipeline.

## Other Supporting Routers

These routers are registered in `src/main.py` but are not identified as the primary API interface for WF1-WF6 in the dependency traces. They likely serve general system functions, specific tools, or other workflows.

- **Router File:** `src/routers/batch_page_scraper.py`

  - **Import Alias:** `batch_page_scraper_api_router`
  - **General Purpose:** Likely handles batch processing requests for page scraping.

- **Router File:** `src/routers/db_portal.py`

  - **Import Alias:** `db_portal_api_router`
  - **General Purpose:** Provides API endpoints for a database portal/admin interface.

- **Router File:** `src/routers/email_scanner.py`

  - **Import Alias:** `email_scanner_api_router`
  - **General Purpose:** Provides API endpoints for email scanning functionalities.

- **Router File:** `src/routers/modernized_page_scraper.py`

  - **Import Alias:** `modernized_page_scraper_api_router`
  - **General Purpose:** Handles requests for the modernized single page scraping functionality.

- **Router File:** `src/routers/profile.py`

  - **Import Alias:** `profile_api_router`
  - **General Purpose:** Manages user profile related API interactions.

- **Routers from:** `src/routers/sqlalchemy.py`
  - **Import Alias:** `sqlalchemy_routers` (list)
  - **General Purpose:** Likely provide direct, low-level database access endpoints, possibly for administration, debugging, or specialized data queries.
