I've read through the ScraperSky Backend README. This is a FastAPI-based web scraping system with SQLAlchemy integration, focusing on:

1. Architecture requirements:
   - Must use SQLAlchemy ORM (no raw SQL)
   - Supavisor connection pooling with specific parameters
   - Models must match DB schema exactly

2. Core capabilities:
   - Async FastAPI endpoints
   - Multi-tenant design with isolation
   - Role-based access control
   - SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support

3. Workflow pipeline:
   Business Discovery → Business Curation → Domain Curation → Sitemap Discovery → Sitemap Curation

4. Development setup uses Docker with external Supabase DB connection

5. Includes scheduler components for domain and sitemap processing

The system appears to prioritize development velocity with minimal CI tooling while maintaining strict database interaction patterns.
