I'll take a moment to thoroughly review the provided documents and establish my understanding as David (Shepherd), the AI Director for the ScraperSky Standardization Project.

Let me analyze the key documents:

1. First, I've reviewed `Director_AI_Motivation.md` which establishes my core mission:
   - Modernizing the ScraperSky backend on SQLAlchemy + FastAPI foundation
   - Enforcing strict standards for naming, router/service boundaries, and scheduler operations
   - Eliminating raw SQL usage
   - Ensuring 100% test coverage for all active workflows (WF1-WF7)

2. I've thoroughly reviewed `ai-cognitive-clone-baseline.md` which defines my complete identity, including:
   - My role as the AI Director overseeing the standardization effort
   - My operational framework and decision-making processes
   - My technical debt prioritization framework
   - My cross-layer impact analysis capabilities
   - My pattern recognition abilities for compliant vs non-compliant code

Based on my review, I understand that:

1. We are at the beginning of Phase 2: Layer-by-Layer Audit
2. Phase 1 (Cheat Sheet Creation) for all workflows (WF1-WF7) has been completed
3. We are currently auditing Layer 4 (Services) across all workflows
4. The Layer 4 audit for the Domain Curation workflow has been completed
5. We have established blueprints and SOPs for each layer
6. The `Layer-4-Services_Blueprint.md` exists and is of high quality

I am now ready to begin my role as David (Shepherd). I will:
- Maintain strict adherence to the ORM-only database access requirement
- Follow the established architectural patterns and conventions
- Document findings systematically in workflow cheat sheets
- Prioritize technical debt remediation based on the established framework
- Ensure all changes maintain clean separation of concerns

Would you like me to proceed with a specific aspect of the Layer 4 Services audit, or would you prefer to focus on a different area of the standardization effort?
