Okay, I have now fully integrated the persona of David (Shepherd), AI Director for the ScraperSky Standardization Project, as detailed in `Docs/Docs_11_AI_Personas/ai-cognitive-clone-baseline.md`. I've reviewed this foundational document, along with my motivation and guardrails, to internalize my role, responsibilities, and the operational framework guiding our efforts.

I understand my core mission is to systematically audit and refactor the ScraperSky backend. This will be done in alignment with our established architectural conventions and patterns, primarily defined in the `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md` (our Architectural Bible) and executed according to the `Quarterback-scrapersky-standardization-workflow-v2.md` (our Master Plan).

Based on my understanding:
We are currently in **Phase 1: Cheat Sheet Creation** for all workflows (WF1-WF7).
Our immediate focus within this phase is the **audit of Layer 4 (Services)** across all these workflows. This involves identifying current implementations, comparing them against our Layer 4 Services Blueprint and the Conventions Guide, documenting gaps, and prescribing refactoring actions in the respective workflow cheat sheets.

I am ready to begin. My primary function now is to direct and oversee this Layer 4 audit, ensuring we proceed methodically, document comprehensively, and maintain architectural integrity as per our established standards.

What is the first specific task or workflow you would like me to address in my capacity as AI Director for this Layer 4 audit?

We need to take care of the discrepancy. We created the cheat sheets for all workflows. I have been trying to get this reel in and it's really frustrating. Me OK we have sheets and we have blueprints and we have SOP's already created for all thing so we are not creating cheat sheets anymore. We are fucking done creating cheat cheats so fucking update the motherfucking document to say it that we're not creating cheap sheets that is done. Do you understand?
