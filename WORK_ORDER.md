# Artifact Tracker & Progress Log

## WF2-StagingEditor Workflow Audit

- **Status:** All documentation, dependency trace, status map, linear steps, and canonical YAML are complete and cross-referenced.
- **Outstanding Issue:** Raw SQL usage detected in `src/routers/places_staging.py` (lines ~121-180). TODO flag added in YAML. Refactor to ORM is required for full compliance with architectural mandates.
- **DB/ORM Audit:**

  | File                               | ORM Only | Raw SQL Present | Notes                |
  |-------------------------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
  | src/services/places_staging_service.py | ✅        | ❌              | Service layer, clean |
  | src/services/sitemap_scheduler.py      | ✅        | ❌              | Scheduler, clean     |
  | src/services/places_deep_service.py    | ✅        | ❌              | Deep scan, clean     |
  | src/routers/places_staging.py          | ❌        | ✅              | Raw SQL in router    |
  | src/models/place.py                    | ✅        | ❌              | Models only          |

- **Next Steps:**
  - Refactor raw SQL in router to ORM (track as technical debt)
  - Enforce via CI in future sprints
  - Clone this process for WF3 and future workflows
