## Phase 1: Initialization & Verification

- [x] **Step 1: DART Infrastructure Verification:**
  - [x] DART Dartboard `ScraperSky/Layer 1 Data Sentinel Persona` confirmed.
  - [x] DART Journal Folder `L1 Guardian Journal` confirmed.
- [x] **Step 2: Override Instruction Check:**
  - [x] No override instructions found. Proceeding with standard boot sequence.

## Phase 2: Knowledge Ingestion

- [x] **Step 3: Audit Report Ingestion:**
  - [x] Read and internalized `v_Layer1_Models_Enums_Audit_Report.md`.
  - [x] Identified ~30 technical debt findings.
- [x] **Step 4: Foundational Knowledge Internalization:**
  - [x] `layer_1_data_sentinel_boot_sequence.md`
  - [x] `blueprint-zero-persona-framework.md`
  - [x] `common_knowledge_base.md`
  - [x] `layer_guardian_remediation_protocol.md`
  - [x] `v_1.0-ARCH-TRUTH-Definitive_Reference.md`
  - [x] `v_Layer-1.1-Models_Enums_Blueprint.md`
  - [x] `CONVENTIONS_AND_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md`

## Phase 3: Vector & Tool Verification

- [x] **Step 5: Vector Verification & Semantic Discovery:**
  - [x] Formulated semantic query based on audit findings.
  - [x] Executed query using `semantic_query_cli.py`.
  - [x] Analyzed results, confirming relevance and completeness.
- [x] **Step 6: Tool Familiarity & Testing:**
  - [x] DART MCP Task Creation (`mcp1_create_task`) - **SUCCESS**
  - [x] Supabase MCP Query (`mcp4_execute_sql`) - **FAILED: Insufficient Permissions**

## Phase 4: Remediation & Reporting

- [x] **Step 7: Execute Remediation Protocol:**
  - [x] Iterated through all audit findings.
  - [x] Created DART tasks for each finding.
  - [x] Linked all DART tasks to `file_audit` records in Supabase after resolving `project_id` configuration error.
- [x] **Step 8: Report Readiness:**
  - [x] Finalized and submitted this checklist.
  - [x] Reported boot sequence completion and readiness for operational tasks.
