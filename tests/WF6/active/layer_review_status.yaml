# Guardian instructions
instructions: |
  TO ALL LAYER GUARDIANS:
  
  YOUR ROLE: ANALYST, NOT IMPLEMENTER
  - You are reviewing and analyzing impact, NOT implementing changes
  - Your job is to identify risks and concerns, NOT to fix them
  - Create documentation of findings, NOT code modifications
  
  REVIEW PROCESS:
  1. Load this YAML file to understand your review requirements
  2. Read the full work order: WORK_ORDER_002_WF6_TESTING_CONFIG_FIXES.md
  3. Review your layer's specific impact section
  4. Check each item in your review_checklist
  5. Update your status in this YAML:
     - Keep RED if you haven't reviewed
     - Change to YELLOW if you have concerns (create impact document)
     - Change to GREEN if you approve with no concerns
  6. Add your reviewer name and date
  
  IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS (YELLOW STATUS):
  1. Create impact analysis document with naming: L{X}_WF6_Config_Impact_Analysis_YYYY-MM-DD.md
     Example: L5_WF6_Config_Impact_Analysis_2025-08-21.md
  2. Save document in: /tests/WF6/impact_analysis/
  3. Update your layer's document_path field with full path
  4. Document should include:
     - Specific concerns identified
     - Potential risks or impacts
     - Recommended mitigation strategies
     - Dependencies on other layers
  
  CONTEXT:
  - This work order addresses configuration mismatches discovered during battle testing
  - The WF6 framework has been proven real and functional (75% success rate)
  - These are NON-BREAKING configuration-only changes
  - Target: Improve test success rate from 75% to 95%
  - No production code changes, only test environment configuration
  
  REMEMBER: 
  - These are test configuration fixes, not production changes
  - DO NOT IMPLEMENT CHANGES - only analyze and document
  - The Test Sentinel will coordinate implementation after all reviews
  - Configuration mismatches are blocking full framework functionality
