üö® NUCLEAR SHARED SERVICE - APScheduler Core Engine
=====================================================
‚ö†Ô∏è  SERVES: ALL WORKFLOWS (WF1-WF7) - Complete background processing
‚ö†Ô∏è  DELETION BREAKS: Entire ScraperSky automation pipeline
‚ö†Ô∏è  GUARDIAN DOC: WF0_Critical_File_Index.md (SHARED.1)
‚ö†Ô∏è  MODIFICATION REQUIRES: System-wide architecture review

üîí DISASTER HISTORY: Part of June 28, 2025 refactoring disaster
üîí PROTECTION LEVEL: NUCLEAR - DO NOT MODIFY without understanding all workflows
üîí DEPENDENCIES: WF2 deep scans, WF3 domain extraction, WF4 sitemap submission,
                 WF5 sitemap processing, WF6 URL import, domain analysis

CRITICAL: This is the heart of ALL background processing. Deletion or
modification will break multiple workflows simultaneously.

Centralized APScheduler Instance

This module initializes and provides a single, shared instance of
AsyncIOScheduler for use across the application to manage background tasks.
